even if our company didn't have a dress code , i still think people would wear formal clothing to work . <eou> i wouldn't be so sure ... people want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . <eou> maybe that's true for some positions , but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . they dress for success ! you can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . it's just not respectful to you client . <eou> i think what you wear is so overrated . i would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . <eou>
