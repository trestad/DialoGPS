i want you to put your hands behind your head ! you are under arrest !
well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .
what other sources of energy do you use ?
we don't use any fossil fuels . most of our power comes from hydro - electric plants . we're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .
do you know there are several catagories of chinese tea ?
yes , i believe there are green teas , black teas and scented teas . any others ?
well , have you ever heard of oulong tea and compressed tea ?
oh , yeah . oulong tea is good for one's health . isn't it ?

do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ?
yes , in most circumstances .
are you available for travel ?
yes , i like travelling . i am young , and unmarried . it's no problem for me to travel frequently .
how bad did i do ?
to be completely honest , you failed your test .
how ?
there were a number of reasons .
what were they ?
basically , you just can't drive .
can i have another try ?
you can take it in a couple weeks .
don't worry , young man . lat me give you an examination . first let me take a look at your throat . open your mouth and say'ah ' .
ah .
your throat is inflamed . and your tongue is heavily coated . you have all the symptoms of influenza .
what am i supposed to do then ?
a good rest is all you need , and drink more water . i'll write you a prescription .
thank you very much .
which condiment do you use for ?
i'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .

no , don't need , i can do myself .
thanks . i can watch tv now .
but you must cook that dinner next time .
okay , i'll do it next time .
kara , i had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this friday .
mike , i don't think that it's a good idea to go out again . i really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home .
maybe we could just meet for coffee or something .
i can't really deal with any distractions right now , but i appreciate the nice evening we spent together .
ok , that shall be arranged .
i didn't think of it . thank you . and i do apologize for being late .
thanks so much .
my plans are to be there april 14th to the 17th .
we have new room rates , sir . will that be acceptable to you ?
well , it depends on the price , of course . what is it ?
it's $ 308 a night .
i have no problem with that .
great ! would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?
definitely nonsmoking . i can't handle that smell .
nonsmoking . now , is a queen - size bed okay ?
no problem .
great , mr . sandals . your reservation is confirmed . now all i need is your phone number .
of course ! it's area code 626 - 555 - 1739 .
thank you so much , mr . sandals . we look forward to seeing you !
i believe you have charged me twice for the same thing . look , the figure of 6 . 5 dollar appears here , then again here .
i'll just go and check it for you , sir .
oh , how awful ! may i have a look at the invoice ?
here it is .
well . please accept our sincere apologies , i'll be glad to change it for another one if you wish .
that's very kind of you . thank you .
we're sorry that this has happened , and i guarantee that the same mistake won't happen again .
i like the sound of that .
yes , that is today's sale price .
a dozen will be fine .
is there anything else you'd like to get ?
no , thank you .
these roses should make your wife very happy .
ok sir , please wait a minute .
i apologize , but i didn't realize that i did .
weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?
i did learn that .
so , then why did you speed up ?
i don't know what to tell you .
i'm going to have to write you a ticket .
i understand .
here you go . don't do that again .
besides i want two copies of all the photos .
is that really all that you eat ?
that's basically it .
how do you stick to only those foods ?
actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .
yeah , i know , but what about the chicken ?
i mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .
that does sound pretty good .
i know it does , and that's because it is .
i'm sorry , but you won't be able to view it today .
why not ?
you have to make an appointment first .
oh , okay . can i do that right now ?
is this friday okay ?
is 6 o'clock friday evening okay ?
yes , i will schedule you for that time .
thank you very much . see you then .
yes , all the insurance will be linked with your work . we will issue an insurance policy .
here is your change . please wait for your receipt of the registered mail .
i also want to pack up my package . this is the notes .
let me see . en . . just a minute . here it is . i need your signature on this note .
oh , one more thing , where can i mail this letter ?
drop it in the mail box mark out of town . at that corner .
thank you very much .
you're welcome .
would you like to reserve a private dining room ?
that sounds like a good idea .
all right . may i have your name , sir ?
my name is ron kollwitz .
i did , but he wasn't able to either .
would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ?
well , to begin with , i would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average .
have you had any experience with computer ?
yes , i studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer .
that's fine . what about operating the fax and duplicator ?
i can handle them without any trouble
what have you learned from jobs you have held ?
above all , i have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . so i follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed .
very good .
how come ? last time i saw you . you told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . that was only one month ago . why this sudden change ?
it's a long story . in a word , i didn't do a good job of it . i messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and i messed it up .
what are you going to do now ?
i am trying to find a job asap . lily doesn't know yet . i didn't tell her . i spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought i went to work as usual .
that's not the way to solve the problem . did you look in the classified advertisements column ?
yes , i did . but i wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in .
listen . i will see what i can do , ok ? you go home and tell lily about this problem you have now . she is your wife and i am sure she will understand .
i just don't know how to bring it up . well , all right . she has the right to know anyways .
i parked in the red zone .
why did you do that ?
i needed to get something really quick .
where did you park at ?
at my apartment building .
don't you have your own parking spot ?
i needed to be fast .
that was very lazy of you .
do you have the statement for your card ?
here it is .
what are the charges you're referring to ?
the last four charges on the page .
i'm afraid we're going to have to investigate these charges .
how long will an investigation take ?
i honestly don't know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .
that sounds absolutely fantastic .
ok , could i take a look at some i d please , like a passport ?
here you go . by the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ?
no , i'm afraid that isn't possible . you must wait until maturity before you cash them .
i had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won't be able to come to school today .
my goodness ! are you ok ?
i broke my leg , but it is healing .
how long will you be out of class ?
i should be able to return by next monday .
fine . well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . i hope you feel better soon .
yeah , i have a little one myself . anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . i would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly . i could have it all finished by today if it's urgent .
that would be great ! is it expensive ?
let's see . . . i would say about eight hundred dollars .
ok . here you are .
could i have some fruit ?
of course . wait for a moment , please .
how are you getting along with your business ?
not bad . the fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .
i hope we can do more business together . though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . in the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance .
it is a good idea . what dish are you cooking now ? !
i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . have you ever tried steamed fish ?
yes , i have . but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . the fish is not well - done and too salty .
that's the case . i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .
i have the same idea as yours .
it's ok . please have a taste of it .
thank you . oh , it's very delicious .
thank you for your praise .
besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?
i am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .
so many dishes . next friday week is my birthday . i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , ok ?
why not ? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .
thanks a lot .
it's my pleasure .
sir , we are terribly sorry for that . we will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . is that all right ?
that's fine .
ok .
a bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .
then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .
i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .
so do i .
she's kind of short .
what height is she ?
she's probably about five feet .
that's nice , but tell me what she looks like .
the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes .
i think i might've bumped into her before .
are you telling me that you've seen her before ?
i believe so .
san francisco ? no , sir . we only have this office here . you will have to return it here .
really ? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities .
no , sir . that's only with the very big companies . i'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot .
well , i guess i will have to drive back down then . hmm . i didn't think of that .
do you still want the car , sir ?
yes . it will be fun . driving back down the coast . my girlfriend will like it .
it's a beautiful drive .
where are the keys ?
just a moment , sir . we have to finish filling out the forms .
true . i would like to have some salmon sashimi and a roast salmon head .
you sound like a seafood expert . i would like to have some stir - fried squids and steamed shrimps .
you are not too bad as well . i also want to have a steamed lobster . it is really taste like heaven .
let's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food .
wait . let me tell the lady what we would like to order in front of the seafood fridge first .
ok . i will wait for you inside the restaurant
do you think we should try some deep fried oysters ?
it will cost you $ 10 .
by the way , what's the time ?
you can see the time on the meter . i have radio time , you know .
it's a quarter to 12 . could you please drive a little faster ?
certainly .
you are right .
this is the very thing i've been dreaming of .
it is the best quality porcelain - the famous egg - shell china .
it must be most precious .
but it is really worth the price .
please mail this letter for me on your way to the store .
sure . do you want it to be registered ?
yes , i think so . there are some pictures in it . it would be a great pity if they were lost .
yes , i will be glad to mail your letter .
thanks .
you are welcome .
damn it ! i'm injured here . we could wait all day for the police .
well , you'll just have to wait . i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . don't worry . you'll get to the hospital in time .
it really hurts .
yes , maybe it does . but if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?
to hell with you . the accident was your fault .
i'm afraid it wasn't . and when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . but enough of this bickering . i'm going to go find a phone . don't move that arm while i'm gone . alright ?
to hell with you .
sure . it's to raise money for the homeless .
what about the performance itself ?
oh , it's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .
wow , a story about the clever monkey king . it's a classic and children's favorite .
it surely is . and the cast is really the best .
wonderful ! how much is the ticket ?
the price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .
perhaps one year , i'm not sure .
sorry , it's not available now . anything else ?
we still prefer french dressing .
just a beer , please .
good . thank you . sir .
would you like to have some more beer ?
no , thanks . i've had enough . i'll have my bill , please .
of course . please wait a moment . i'll go and get it .
thank you .
i'll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
that's right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .
it's always easier to say something than to do it .
it's not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well - groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .
but i love wearing t - shirts and jeans .
i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .
it's a pity that i can not afford more expensive clothes .
you misunderstood me . clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .
i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
it seems that'clothes make the man ' .
it may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .
hang on a tick and i'll check for you . i'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving .
ok , thanks for checking . could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ?
no problem . i'll be in touch as soon as it comes in .
sure . we have a one - day trip along the river . it's quite beautiful .
just that in effect , a basic letter of credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds .
that sounds fine , thanks for that . let's go ahead !
where was the break - in ?
it happened at my house .
was anything stolen ?
i haven't checked yet .
why do you think there was a break - in ?
my front window was broken .
we'll send a squad car shortly .
i'd appreciate that .
oh , yeah . i forgot tax . give me four then , please .
okay . thanks .
that's all . have a nice stay here .
thank you . please get some soap for us .
just a moment . i will do it right now .
according to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . i think my background meets the requirement of this position .
then tell me something about your background .
my major was computer science when i was at college , and i am quite familiar with visual c + + and java language .
well , what do you think about the development in computers ?
the developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . in some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . so i think the software industry has a great future .
have you ever designed any programs concerning network ?
yes , i have designed some programs for the network with visual c + + and i have passed the test for programmers - muse .
have you got anything to ask me ?
yes , can you tell me what's my responsibility in this position ?
yes , of course . you would be responsible for the development of software products .
i see . this is my advantage .
good . have you got any other questions ?
no .
ok , i will contact you in a week . see you .
thank you , bye - bye .
hmm , 250nt is . . . 8 dollars ? ! ! and you can't even eat them ? you're crazy !
wait ! don't go just yet . these bananas are pretty cheap -- only 35nt for this bunch .
now that's more like it ! bananas have lots of potassium , too !
they're also good for your digestion ! would you like some kiwis , too ?
are they from taiwan ?
they're imported from new zealand . four for 50nt . nine for a hundred .
ok . i'll take four kiwis .
it's complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this company is downsizing and i can't continue working for a company that may let me go .
but surely they won't fire you ! you're one of the most experienced managers here !
well , to be honest , there's another reason . i've got a better offer .
well that's great news ! congratulations ! where will you be located ?
the head office is in new york , but i'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time .
it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity .
i have . i feel lucky . i look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use english more .
i'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ?
of course i can . in fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , i'll recommend you personally .
thanks . i appreciate that .
sure . let me help you .
yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ?
sure , no problem . here you are . that'll be 25 dollars .
do you take credit cards ?
yes , we accept visa and mastercard .
ok , here you are .
thanks . i'll be right back .
ok .
here's your receipt .
thank you .
you're welcome . please come again .
you'd look before you leap .
thanks for your concern .
that's right . it's over there .
thanks a lot .
not at all .
she is eight . actually , i'm buying a good set of art supplies for her as a birthday gift .
it's a wise thing to do . art will do a child a world of good .
o . k . no problem . anything else ?
no , but if she has any questions , she can call me at 555 - 2345 .
all right , i'll leave her the message , mary . thanks for calling .
thank you . bye .
goodbye .
let's make it a formal affair .
yes , that would be best . now , for food should we have chinese or american food ?
american food would be the best choice .
that would be great . what kind of music would you like , a band or recorded music ?
we should bring in a really good dj .
that works for me . let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on friday .
oh . . . i'm such a newbie . but at least i'm sure i'll get that tennis racket .
don't count on it , babe . ebay is always full of surprises .
well . . . guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
no , thanks . i already have credit cards .
but our credit card saves you 10 percent .
that's a nice discount .
here . let me give you an application form .
thank you , but i'm just browsing today .
okay . enjoy your browsing .
let's get frozen juice . it is really good . we've got enough food . let's go over to the check - out stand .
ok . but just let me pick up a bottle of cooking wine and oil as we go by .
i ran my car into a tree yesterday and need to miss a few days of school .
oh , my god ! i hope you are all right .
i have a concussion , but i will be ok .
how much school will you miss ?
i only need to take this week off .
i appreciate you calling and telling me that you won't be in class . see you next week !
great .
honey , if you don't want to go to cram school , you should tell me the reason why .
i'm sorry , dad . but i would rather stay at school than go to cram school .
i want to get some pie .
what kind of pie do you want ?
i have no idea .
do you want to know what kind of pie i like ?
sure , what kind do you like ?
i love apple pie .
oh , i love apple pie too .
there you go . problem solved .
we can change only three kinds of currency , usd , japanese yen and hk dollar in our savings office .
could you tell me what the exchange rate for usd is today ?
the buying rate is 826 . 44 yuan for 100 dollars .
i want to change some us dollars to cover my expense here .
please go to counter no . 2 , the foreign exchange counter . it's over there .
thank you .
never mind being sorry , what are you going to do about it ?
don't worry , we'll soon fix them .
good , i hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .
i'll certainly look into that .
thank you . goodbye .
is there a price reduction ?
we are having a sale now . the price has already gone down .
how much is that one ?
it's two hundred and eighty dollars .
ok . i'll take it . thank you .
alright . there are several models you may want to look at . this kreng portable cassette player is very good .
kreng ? i've never heard of that company .
it's a german company . this unit has auto - reverse , recording capability , and an am / fm radio band . it also has a built - in microphone .
i suppose i don't want that one then . i don't like auto - reverse . it breaks too easily .
really ? have you had an auto - reverse break before ?
yes , twice now . i think it's too high - tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .
hmm . you know , the problem might be dust . did you clean the unit often ?
well . no , i didn't clean it . but still , i only had the last one two months , and it broke . i don't trust auto - reverse .
alright . well . we have many units without auto - reverse . here is a good unit . very reliable . it has an am / fm band , built - in microphone , recording capability , and no auto - reverse .
how much is it ?
this one sells for $ 39 . 99 .
can i test it out ?
of course .
it sounds great . i'll take it .
fine . i think you'll be happy with it . it's a very good unit . very reliable . i'll go get you a new one in a box . i will be back in just a moment .
thanks .
are you interested in a full - time or part - time position ?
i am more interested in a full - time position . however , i would also consider a part - time position .
can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?
i advised customers on financial matters . after i consulted the customer , i completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . i then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . the clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that i formulated on a quarterly basis .
what is your greatest strength ?
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .
what is your greatest weakness ?
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however , i began setting time - limits for myself .
why do you want to work for our company ?
after following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , i am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and i would like to be a part of that team .
when can you begin ?
immediately .
it is just too dark in here with so few windows .
i hear that the kitchen is quite large . let's go check it out .
the kitchen may be large , but it doesn't have any storage space .
the master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . maybe it will be a little better .
how many dogs live in this house ?
i think that we have seen all that we need to see here . let's go look at another house .
that's great , bring me a bottle of that please .
oops , cancel that . change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?
no sooner said than done . can i help you with anything else ?
no , that's about it for now . thanks .
okay , sir . have a pleasant evening .
don't worry . you can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . the bus stop is right there .
thank you very much .
my pleasure .
i see . we will go the day after tomorrow .
by the way , what kind of stores do we need to go ?
i want to buy some clothes in clothing store . when we are going back , go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken .
let's also go to the jewelry store to buy a crystal necklace . i want to buy one for you as your birthday present .
thank you , darling .
yes , the towel was named after its designer gustave eiffel .
how do you spell your name , please ?
my first name is j - u - d - y , and my last name is w - a - n - g .
please note that this ticket has a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
it's ok . where should i pay for the penalty ?
at the airport . ok , miss . wang , your flight 8 on july 19 from taipei to minneapolis is canceled . your new reservation is trans pacific flight 8 from taipei to minneapolis at 9 thirty a . m . on august 2 .
that's 1poj7403 .
that's correct .
thank you !
is there anything else i can do for you ?
no , thanks . i'm all set . good - bye .
he has a mustache , if i remember correctly , and a light complexion .
how old is he ?
he is in his late thirties .
well . i shouldn't have any trouble recognizing him . what time does his flight arrive ?
at 2 thirty .
would you like a drink ?
let me have a soda .
what kind of soda would you like ?
may i have a sprite , please ?
sure , no problem .
i would also like a bag of chips .
will that be all ?
that's everything .
do you have any work experience in promotion ?
yes , i do . i have worked as a salesman for p & g company ltd .
do people respond well to you ?
yes , i'm good with people .
let's have a look at the menu . oh , there isn't a menu . do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ?
yes , of course . excuse me . could you possibly let us see your menu ? oh . they haven't got one either .
your discount is already included . normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . this is our sale period .
it's still too much . can't you make it any cheaper than that ?
sorry , but this is the best price . you can't get it any cheaper than here .
i see . can i pay by traveler's checks ?
i'm afraid you can't . you're welcome to pay in cash .
i didn't know i needed change .
the washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .
where do i put the change ?
the quarters go into the slot . you have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .
is that everything that i have to do ?
that's all there is .
i appreciate you helping me with this .
if you need anything else , just let me know .
that's the company policy .
what happens if i use up my sick days before the end of the year ? if i'm sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?
yes . that's the company policy .
it was the same as the last place i worked at . i was hoping you'd be different .
i don't think i ever got food from the cafeteria .
i actually like the food there .
does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ?
they have anything you want .
i was thinking about getting some chinese food .
i bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . it tasted great .
we can eat at the cafeteria .
i think you'll really like the food there .
thank you .
well , i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .
that's a good idea .
first , let's read clause two about packing . it's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . that'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . so , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .
agreed .
for shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . so would you allow us to make partial shipments .
i understand your position .
that looks great . do you have ties here ?
i should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . do you have any suggestion in mind ? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .
that's why i came to your office today . we think for your model we - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579 - 649 .
that's true . but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .
i see your point . that's to say s 611 each set . still it's much higher than the market price . could you see your way to reduce the price , jack ?
well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . that's the best we can do . what do you think of that ?
all right . we accept it . so $ 600 for each set .
very well . thank you .
if you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks .
but if i don't pass , will you call me ?
i'm sorry we won't . you can wait for two weeks . if you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .
then do i have the chance to get this job ?
i'm sorry but i can't make the final decision myself , and i have to discuss it with other interviewers .
i know . no matter what the result will be , i have learned a lot from our conversation .
your mentality is very good and that's great .
thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .
my pleasure .
were you involved in any club activities at your university ?
yes . i was a member of the student poetry society . i like writing poems in my spare time .
what extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?
i sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball .
i don't know . i just need to try it once . i'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .
you should try swimming then . it helps you to keep fit .
ok . please fill in the form first .
do you do the same exercises every day ?
no , i've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push - ups , sit - ups , bunny - hops , five - kilometer run , and so on . i alternate them over the weekdays . sometimes , when i find myself in a bad state , i will simply idle about in the park .
why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?
it's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it's interesting to join them .
oh , yes . singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally .
oh , that's ideal .
i don't know . but i have a carsickness .
you'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .
thank you .
i can take a little time off of work , or i can go on a weekend , also .
we could meet at the real estate office , or i could pick you up at your home .
i am leaving from work , so maybe i could just meet you at the first house that we will look at .
i can think of five houses that we should look at . it will take most of the day .
i would like to see as many as possible .
when i have confirmed the times with the owners , i will e - mail you our plans for the day .
we will take the trip . could you give us a pamphlet ?
here you are .
yes , sir . american breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up . breakfast juice and black coffee . and my correct , sir ?
yes , that's right .
is there anything else , sir ?
no , that's all .
good morning , sir . i've got breakfast your ordered .
just put it on the table please .
do you need anything else , sir ?
no , thanks . oh , yes , could i have some juice for the mini bar ?
what kind of juice do you like sir ?
tomato or orange juice , please .
yes , sir . i'll get them for you right away . would you please sign this bill first ? thank you , sir .
how much is the ticket ?
it's 86 coach and 175 berths
one berth , please .
is it a long ride to beijing library ?
it will take about thirty minutes because it is the rush hour .
thirty minutes , that will be all right . there are still fifty minutes to go before the library is open . look , what are they doing on the square ?
it is an exhibition of chinese jades . it is held each year . a nice collection jades of are on display and sold .
sounds great ! can you stop somewhere here for a minute ? i will get some souvenirs for my friends .
no problem .
put your luggage on the scale , please . oh , your luggage is overweight .
how much is the excess baggage part charge ?
twenty - two dollars
here you are .
this is your voucher , and you can get your luggage back on this . have a good trip !
thank you !
and what date will you be returning ?
hmm , i guess on the 28th .
okay , you're booked on american airlines flight 710 , departing jfk at 6
sounds good . thanks a lot .
but it looks good . let me try it on .
ok , the mirror is over there .
that's all right . we'll teach you .
is it anything like american football ?
not very much . it's something like hockey , except that you use a big ball and no stick .
i'll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it's like .
good idea . i think you'll like it if you give it a chance .
i remember that i never saw an x moves even displayed .
now with video rentals it's all a personal matter .
yea , i never see theaters turn people away for their age anymore either .
now we have to make a choice about what we will see and what we won't .
right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?
yes , that's what i am looking for . i will take the room for 2 days .
i think you should definitely consider it ! this way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . i can refer you this great
oh , that's great . thanks grace . can you give me her number ? i'll talk it over with dan and give her a call tomorrow . maybe this way i won't be so tired every day , and dan and i might even get to go
i just turned 18 a month ago .
you're lucky .
what do you mean ?
because you turned 18 in an election year .
i didn't even think of that .
you didn't ?
i really didn't , but i'm still excited .
you should be , because you're a part of history .
is there any special brand you would like ?
could i have look at that pair of canvas shoes ? they look nice .
that's the forbidden city on the north of gate building .
all the sightseeing in china is very attractive and crescive . travelling to china is very worth one . thank you so much for your guides , and i'll miss you .
make it tighter . i want the blood stopped . then wrap some bandages around the cut . then we can go . ouch ! i hope i can walk .
alright , i'm twisting it around . you tell me when to stop .
there . stop !
i'll need them for the conference on monday afternoon . do you think it can be done by then ?
i'll try .
thank you very much , mr . james .
how much does it cost ?
6 yuan . and i can make them as new as before .
i think it's too expensive . i can just give you 4 yuan . or i'll go to another b .
all right . i'll repair them for you .
how long will it take ? could you repair them while i wait ?
yes . they will be ready in a few minutes .
great ! i'll just sit here and wait .
yes . i'm sure . you have the wrong number . i have used this number for more than 20 years .
that can't be true . i remember the number clearly . is your number 1199886 ?
no , it isn't . it's 1199866 . it seems that you have misdialed .
oh , i'm sorry i bothered you . i'm really sorry .
it doesn't matter . it happens to everyone .
sorry again for bothering you .
that's all right .
okay . what's your name , please ?
my name is bruce green .
thanks . please sit down . she'll be with you shortly .
thank you .
oh , they look just like live cranes .
and what is more , in traditional chinese thinking , cranes and pine trees symbolize longevity .
hum . . . you should try the mushroom fettucine . it's really good .
is it salty ?
not at all . it has a very delicate flavor .
what does'duppa del giono'mean ? i'm sorry i don't know how to pronounce that .
oh , that means soup of the day . i'll ask the waiter what they have today . have you tried mussels cooked the italian way ? they're really delicious .
no . i'll try them . sounds good .
ah , well then i'd recommend a nice entry - level digital slr .
yeah ? can i take a look at the sirs you carry ?
sure thing , follow me . this here is the .
the canon eos . yeah it's ok , but i'm looking for something that performs better in low light , has a better display panel , and longer battery life .
oh , ah , um the nikon d60 is a nice option .
yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? i don't want some bulky telephoto lens .
oh , well this one has the , uh .
looks to me like an 18 - 55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !
so , ahem , can i interest you in any acc . . .
accessories ? do you carry polarizing filters ?
polarizing filter um we should ! i'm sorry , ma'am . it looks like we're sold out .
no you're not ! there are some right here !
oh , well , would you look at that ! polarizing filters .
thanks for your help , ralph !
no problem , ma'am .
he'll see it . it says , i like sweets . meet me at two thirty in the parking lot .
can i spy on you guys from the window ?
no . but i'll fill you in later . right now i have to find vince .
you're getting married in three weeks . so that should be ok . so , you've prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel - everything .
yes . we've taken care of all of that . we decided not to get married in a church though . neither of us is very religious .
which hotel will the reception be held at ?
the palace hotel they're taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . i'm sure they'll do a good job .
oh , yes . it's and excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .
yes . it will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . it gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .
i think you make the right decision .
the color is too bright . for my age , i would prefer a lighter color .
i knew you'd see it my way .
sir , i deleted the $ 10 , but i had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .
am i in the twilight zone ? you're charging me for a movie i never saw ?
please don't blame me , sir . blame the computer programmer .
this is highway robbery . i've got a good mind to call the police !
if it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
it's my pleasure . well , then . i'll say goodbye .
goodbye and see you tonight . miss rose .
yes , please . do you have any carry - on items ?
do you want me to put it on the belt , too ?
yes , please . would you please open this big suitcase ?
ok . just a moment . it's just some clothes and toiletries .
ok . do you have anything to declare ?
i think there is nothing .
any fresh food , live plants , or animals ?
oh , no . none of that .
thank you . you may lock up your suitcase . here are your passports .
thanks a lot .
i don't know what we need .
why don't you go and check the refrigerator ?
i would appreciate it if you would do that for me .
why don't you just get the basics ?
what do you mean ?
eggs , milk , bread . things like that .
go make that list .
sure , no problem .
thanks a lot .
our team was victorious .
i wish i was free that night . i'm kind of mad that i didn't go .
it was a great game .
what was the score at the end of the game ?
our team won 101 - 98 .
sounds like it was a close game .
that's the reason it was such a great game .
the next game , i will definitely be there .
that happens . without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e - shop may suddenly disappear .
what's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .
it's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . paying online is much safer than before , but i still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .
i can't agree more . that's why i only do street shopping .
me too . sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .
that's a good idea .
does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?
yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
it's such a large firm . do we have our own staff restaurant ?
yes , at the end of the hall .
i'm sorry , mr . richard . mr . johnson is on his way to the office . he had just called and asked you to wait a minute .
well , i'll wait .
would you like something to drink , sir ? do you prefer coffee or tea ?
thank you . coffee , please .
here you are , mr . richard . this is the cream and this is the sugar . if there's anything else you'd like , please don't hesitate to tell me .
thank you very much .
where did the break - in happen ?
it happened at my house .
was anything taken ?
i'm not sure yet .
what makes you think there was a break - in ?
my front window was busted .
i'll send a squad car .
please hurry .
now , i'd like to get things under way . the main topic on today's agenda is the development of a u . s . sales strategy for the new ebb . i'd like to hear all of your ideas , mr . wall , you seem in top form today . could you start the ball rolling ?
uh , oh , sure . well , i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .
well , that's kind of obvious .
give me a break , mr yang .
uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?
actually , the factory is located in scotland .
really ? i didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production
that's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here , i brought these especially for you , try one !
oh , thanks . mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth . . .
unique , aren't they ? i bet you've never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .
yes , very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy , very unique , that's for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations . i'm sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and haggis .
haggis ? what's haggis ?
it's a traditional scottish delicacy , you take sheep's liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep's stomach .
ah , get back to you .
mr . johnson ? mr . johnson ?
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , i wouldn't get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .
other company rules also need your attention .
like this one ? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . yeah , thank you for telling me .
don't mention it .
is it too late to mail the continued claim form in now ?
it can't be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .
i will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .
you can't possibly know in advance how much you will be working . if you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !
will my paycheck arrive late because i messed up on my form ?
your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time .
i'm going to spend some time exploring the city . what can i do with my luggage ?
sir , right here we have a storage site . its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .
a deposit ? isn't my luggage a deposit ?
i'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . your mastercard or visa will take care of things nicely .
okay . let me think about this .
okay , sir . but don't take too long . you only have 30 minutes .
you can refund it in 7 days and exchange it in one year .
that's right .
it looks pretty good . i think i'll take it .
would you like anything else ?
that's all thank you .
the sales lady said that even if i eat right , i wouldn't get enough vitamins .
have you ever tried it ? or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?
it's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .
it may take less time , but i don't know about easier . yuck .
well , as far as i can tell , we qualify .
of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . as soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .
did you lose any weight ?
yes . i've lost quite a few pounds since last month .
when was the last time you have track up ?
about two month ago .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anilic . well , mr . brown . i'm happy to say it's nothing serious . you just a little run down from overwork .
what am i suppose to do ?
i think you'll needs just vacation . try to get out doors more . i'll be sure if you get more rest .
thank you , doctor . i'll do what you say .
how long will you be staying ?
just two weeks .
how many pieces of baggage have you got ?
only one . in this case , i have a camera .
do you intend to take it out on your departure ?
yes , i do .
according to the regulations , the camera you've brought along for personal use can be passed for the time being duty free , but you will have to take it out with you when you leave the country .
i will .
well . have a pleasant stay in germany .
thank you .
thank you .
what was your major in school ?
i majored in public relations .
have you done any work in this field ?
yes , after my graduation , i worked in a trade company in macao for one year .
what section did you work in ?
the export business section .
so you must be very familiar with export procedures .
yes , very much .
that's good .
thanks . it's rather cold this morning , wouldn't you say ?
you're right .
do you know the news ?
which one ?
brazil wins the world cup .
yes , i see .
thank you very much .
you're welcome .
do you mean the exquisite pearl earrings ?
exactly . how much do you want for them ?
they're only three thousand yuan .
what is this setting made of ?
well , it's specially made of a platinum alloy , sir , and the lustre will never fade out .
i'ii take them . please wrap them up tor me and give me the receipt .
you've made an excellent choice , sir .
what can i do for you ?
i'd like some grapefruit juice , marmalade , two scrambled eggs with two sausages , toast , and a pot of black coffee , please . how long will it take ?
just a few minutes , ma'am .
great . thank you .
oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
that's terrific . i can't wait to check it out .
hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non - traditional pet ?
why not ? it's so cool .
but it will pose a risk to your health .
pardon ?
i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .
well , i didn't realize that .
i don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
oh , i should have thought of my brother's baby girl . maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
yes , good luck , maria .
would you bring the message to my room .
i'm afraid we have nobody available at the moment .
then i'll come down and pick up the message immediately .
ok , we wait for you .
it's martin scorsese . you liked his film , the departed , didn't you ?
yes , it was fantastic ! can i read the article when you're finished ?
sure . you know it has an online edition , too . you should go online to read if you want to read it now .
that's ok . i'll wait until you're finished . just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ?
no . i don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile .
how much does the magadize cost ?
it's almost three pounds now , and i think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .
that's quite expensive . who is their target audience ?
cosmo mainly has a middle - class readership , but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .
i bet you'll still buy it , though . you wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !
f . y . i . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done . . .
ha ! i'm just warming up ! please take me there now !
yes , i want to know about the battle of gettysburg .
o . k . well , go to google . com , and type in " battle of gettysburg . "
oh wow , there are a lot of sites .
here , try this one . it's a good site about gettysburg .
thanks .
for detailed information , however , you should read a history book .
thanks . if i'm interested , i'll go to the library .
is there some way i can get into contact with him ?
the best way to reach him is by cell phone . i'll give you his number .
thanks . and could i have his e - mail , just in case i can't get him by phone ?
sure . his cell phone is 09112223 33 . and his e - mail is lower case t , smith -- that's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w .
thank you so much . does he read his e - mails daily ?
yes . he usually replies immediately .
great . thanks again . you've been very helpful .
my pleasure . i hope you get a hold of him .
did you lose any weight ?
yes , i have lost quite a few pounds since last month .
when was the last time you had a check - up ?
about two month ago .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anemic .
well , mr . brown , i'm happy to say it's nothing serious .
you're just a little run - down from overwork .
what am i supposed to do ?
i think all you need is just a vacation .
try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest .
thank you , doctor . i'll do as you say .
what happened ?
a man came into the bank with a gun .
that's insane .
i was so scared when i saw the gun .
then what happened ?
he took the money and tried to get away .
did the cops show up in time ?
he didn't even make it out the door .
and how many pieces did you have ?
two suitcases and a handbag . the suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red .
is there a name tag attached to them ?
yes , there is .
we're very sorry for the delay . i'll check immediately and call you back .
is that so ? i'm glad you enjoyed it .
by the way , miss . where is the toilet ?
toilets are in the rear . i'm afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment .
what ?
so wearing a scarf helps your body to stay warm inside your jacket .
yes . that's the secret to wearing a thin jacket .
you know , sometimes i can't feel my ears and fingers .
i'll lend you my gloves and earmuffs until you get your own .
thanks , pam . you're my lifesaver .
yes , i've been observing them .
when you are choosing what to wear , keep all of that in mind . have you chosen what to wear ?
i already have something to wear .
i would always be ready to go shopping with you ! should we talk about other basics ?
ok , i am ready to think of other things .
you need to make sure you arrive on time , smile , be pleasant and friendly , look the person in the eye and answer all questions to the best of your ability . you'll do great !
four hundred yuan .
that's a bit more than i wanted to pay . can you cut the price down a bit ?
i'm sorry . ours is a fixed price shop and i can assure you this is the best price you can get for a mural like this .
maybe you are right . ok , i'll take it .
well , i'll have it wrapped for you .
thank you . here is four hundred yuan .
thank you . please come again .
thank you . i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
i can only afford about 1 ,000 yuan a month .
looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
anything you need to have in the place ?
i want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
you can also check out university bulletin boards .
why ? will those be students who are leaving ?
not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
thank you . i'll be sure to take a look .
good luck .
what kind of flowers would you like ?
i don't know . i don't know too much about flowers . can you recommend something ?
ok . what's the reason you are sending her flowers ?
today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers .
do you know what kind of flowers she likes ?
i'm not sure . i know i should know that , but i can't remember right now .
well , they're for your wife , so i think you should give her roses .
roses will be fine .
what color ?
i think red would be nice .
do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them ?
can you deliver them , please ?
what's the address ?
241 main street .
ok . thanks a lot .
that's nothing .
okay , you're going to need to make an appointment .
i don't understand why i need to make an appointment .
you need to make one to come down and fill out your paperwork .
i'd like to make one now if i could .
sure you can ; when would you like to come in ?
i'd like to come in tomorrow morning at 9
that'll be fine .
that's great . thank you very much .

no problem .
i'm sorry , ms . jenkins is away from her desk . she has already left for lunch . would you like to leave a message for her ?
you look very well , jimmy . you are better now , but you mustn't get up yet . you must stay in bed for another two days . the boy mustn't go to school yet , mrs williams . and he mustn't eat rich food .
does he have a temperature , doctor ?
no , he doesn't .
must he stay in bed ?
yes . he must remain in bed for another two days . he can get up for about two hours each day , but you must keep the room warm . where's mr williams this evening ?
he's in bed , doctor . can you see him , please ? he has a bad cold , too !
mmm . maybe another time .
you could try the ravioli . they are rather like your chinese dumplings , and the sauce is delicious .
sounds good . i think i'll have the lamb for my main course . what does it come with ?
well , you can have fries - french fries - or simple boiled potatoes .
i'll have the potatoes . what are you having ?
i'm having my usual . i like the fish here . would you like some wine ?
oh , yes . that would be lovely .
caterpillar fungus ? ! what the heck is that ?
it's a special kind of chinese herb . it's good for you !
maybe you can hire me on trial . if i'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go .
good idea .
thank you very much .
here's your passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 rib worth of counterfeit notes .
thanks . now can i make the full deposit ?
yes . please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue .
a good atmosphere ? the tree is falling apart , and it's messing up the room .
but it makes the place feel so much like christmas . i'd really hate to have to take it down .
but christmas was two weeks ago ! it's been there only because we've been too busy to get rid of it .
i know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away .
but it's falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches .
i know , i know . but it reminds me of the great christmas we just had . all of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted .
yeah , it was a good christmas . it won't always be this good , but we can't make it last longer than it should .
ok , fine . we need to take down the tree .
i'll make a deal with you . we'll leave it up until sunday , and then we'll take it down after church .
what size would you like ?
medium one will be perfect , thank you
which kind do you want ?
i like seafood on my pizza .
we have two seafood pizzas . tuna and crab .
tuna sounds good today .
would that be for here or take away ?
that would be to go .
that'll be in a ten minutes . please sit over there , and i'll call you over as sooner as it's ready .
no problem .
i'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better . one moment , please . here you are . take these tablets three times a day swallow them with water .
when should i take them ?
take on after each meal .
how long should i continue taking them ?
take them for two days . if your symptoms persist for more than two days , you should see a doctor also , be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration .
thank you for your advice .
20 kg . yours is not overweight . here is your boarding pass and baggage tag . please go to the satellite hall to wait for boarding .
thank you .
oh , great ! that's at the other end of the terminal !
ok , so here's the plan ; when we land , run to gate 14 !
i'm be right behind ya !

i'm sorry . that's the only available time .
are you available this saturday ?
yes . anytime on saturday will be fine .
how does 11
we can do it . see you then .
why is that ?
i really love how rain clears the air .
me too . it always smells so fresh after it rains .
yes , but i love the night air after it rains .

because you can see the stars perfectly .
i really hope it rains today .
yeah , me too .
we'd like a non - smoking table , please .
come with me , please .
do the drivers speak english ?
some are better than others . but , you shouldn't have a problem .
are they safe ?
for the most part , yes . if you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .
hey . i just played basketball earlier , so my legs are a little sore . let's work out on arms and stomach today .
i'm on a weekly schedule . you're messing everything up .
c'mon . we're only switching two days . you can do legs on friday .
aright . i'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then .
not yet , i pick it up tomorrow .
do you know what you will be doing yet ?
yes , i'll be managing the guys on the dock .
you're so good with people . i think they will like you !
by credit .
oh that will be lovely . you'll be able to do lots of shopping i expect .
oh yes and try lots of new food too .
great . make sure you buy me a souvenir !
oh , don't worry , i will !
what do you feel about gay marriage ?
i think everyone has the right to love who they want .
would you legalize gay marriage ?
yes , i would .
many people won't like that .
i'm sure they won't , but that's my view on gay marriage .
i really like you .
i really appreciate that .
i'd like to know more about it .
can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o'clock ?
ok . i will be there .
thank you for calling . goodbye .
bye .
is tim in the garden , too ?
yes , he is . he's climbing the tree .
i beg your pardon ? who's climbing the tree .
tim is .
what about the dog ?
the dog's in the garden , too . it's running across the grass . it's running after a cat .
happy anniversary ! sorry you won't be there . maybe some other time ?
yeah , maybe . thanks , anyway . hope you guys have a great time !
yes . also , i'm not so sure about the color .
well . it doesn't go with your skirt . i think the color itself is fine though .
can you just tell me ?
the election is this tuesday .
are you serious ?
i'm not kidding .
it's a good thing i asked you .
that should've been something you knew already .
i couldn't remember .
whatever . just make sure you go vote .
keep your voice down . we'll talk more later . right now i need to see vince .
we definitely have to talk , zina . and watch your back . elvin is still mad about his nose .
ok , but don't tell anyone what i said .
it actually costs less if you have a bus pass .
how is that ?
you can use it however many times you need to .
is that right ?
yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket .
that sounds nice .
you should go get yours .
yeah , i think i will .
yes .
from video tv .
yes , video tv .
tell him i telephoned . i'd like to see him about the videotapes . can he call me this afternoon ?
yes , of course . what's your telephone number ?
it's , area code 413 , 447 - 9626 .
that is 413 - 447 - 9662 ?
no , that's 447 - 9626 .
oh , i'm sorry , 447 - 9626 .
yes , that's right . extension 162 .
extension 162 . okay , mr . suzuki . i'll give him the message .
thank you . good - bye .
good - bye .
banana pie .
where shall we sit ?
how about there ?
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?
we're planning on having children soon , i don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let's get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i'll tell you what , i can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there .
yay !
here's the swimming pool . it's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . there are also massage rooms here .
that's wonderful ! i like swimming .
after a year together , i thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .
says who ? i don't think that is necessarily the case .
you know , now that i think about it , i really don't have much more to say to you at all !
whatever you say !
certainly . no one who evades tax can escape from their detection . they'll check your income through computers . you'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . if you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .
what happened ?
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog , so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i couldn't fall asleep , because brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me .
what ? he can't do this to you .
well , he did it anyway . then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah . . . you know .
what did you do ?
i shouted it back of course .
hold it , mike . you won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? you worked it all up till now . why not wait until you cool down a bit ?
what would you do if you were in my shoes ?
just stay cool . you know . when you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .
no way , kate . i mean it's just not my fault .
i know . it wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . and after that , you can casually mention the problem . i am sure he will cooperate .
i am too angry to do that .
i like playing cards . i'm pretty good at poker . do you play cards ?
i'm terrible at cards and so i never play games which involve gambling , like poker . if i did , i'd lose all my money .
do you play bridge ?
yes , i do . it's hard to find four players though , so i don't play very often . do you know anyone who plays ? if so , we could set up a game .
i can play quite well . i have a friend who likes playing , but she's not very good at it . shall i invite her to play ?
sure , i have a friend who play fairly well . we should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .
i'll call my friend now . you call yours .
great . what types of things will we do at lushun falls ?
the second day you take a four - hour city tour . in the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .
well , he shouldn't be long . he said he was just going to get some paint . but i wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back .
ok . well , tell him i've called , will you , and i'll try again later .
all right . goodbye , dave .
thanks then sally . goodbye .
group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries .
i see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . interesting . . .
fine . they look nice . i will take both of them .
may i have a look at your passport , please ?
well , we have some painting and some porcelain . which do you like better ?
i'd like porcelain .
good . how about the table set ?
oh , it looks well . i like it very much .
it's made in jingdezhen .
how much is it ?
one thousand eight hundred yuan .
it's not expensive . i'll take it .
great ! b , most of the items listed are available this year . i hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery .
that sounds good . but i have a proposal now .
what's the proposal ?
both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?
good idea ! in this way , our clients'needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .
sounds like we have the same idea .
can i get a quick reply from the sites ?
yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while .
can you tell me more ?
oh , i'm sorry .
no trouble at all . may i know your name and room number ?
i'm du juan , in room 312 .
i see . wait in the room , please .
thank you for your kindness .
your backpack is very big and today's flight is quite full . i am afraid that you will have to check your backpack too .
no problem . what about this carry - on ?
you can take that with you .
can i have an aisle seat , pls .
no problem . i'll give you an aisle seat in the center row . and here is your ticket , passport and boarding pass . please board the plane at gate 15 .
thank you . and when is the latest time for me to board the plane ?
15mins before the plane takes off . the plane is scheduled to leave on time .
thank you very much !
you are welcome ! have a nice flight .
can you operate computers skillfully ?
yes , i can . i have received some special training in computers . besides i am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines .
sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . how do you feel about that ?
that's all right . but could you tell me how often and how many hours i should work overtime ?
it just depends . if we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . it's not unusual .
mr . smith , i's like to ask you a question .
ok , please .
what specific duties would i perform if i am hired ?
nothing different from a secretary's common responsibilities . however , you know , our company is an international trade - oriented company , can you handle english papers and write english correspondence ?
yes . i specialized in english secretary studies at college and that's one of the main parts of my present job .
what are your salary expectations ?
i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position .
the starting monthly salary would be ¥ 2 ,000 , with rises after the half year according to your competence .
i think it's acceptable and i really like the job . and when can i know the decision ?
we'll inform you of our final decision by early july . do you have any other questions ?
no . thank you for the time .
good idea . a network of work stations is helpful for our management .
and , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function .
you are right . the current equipment of our offices really falls behind . next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment .
what date would you like to fly ?
saturday , july 25 .
how many people will be traveling ?
just one adult .
which class ?
economy , please . economy class is the cheapest , right ?
right . ok , the fare is $ 700 .
can't you just tell me now ?
i don't know anything for certain . we always do a double check if there is a question .
i want to see you right away .
you can come in this afternoon . if you are feeling too stressed , feel free to bring a friend along .
i know for sure that something is wrong !
don't worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking .
do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease ?
yes , i think i can in ordinary circumstances .
do you think you can speak english quite fluently ? tell me about your english education .
yes , i think i speak english quite fluently . i got a high score on toefl . i majored in english in college .
ha ! that's right . you used to smoke . i forgot !
when i kicked that habit , i found i had so much more energy . i started exercising .
at the gym ?
no . i like to be outside . i took up hiking and mountain biking .
oh , yes . i had a look yesterday . i found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . the exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . i've gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . i've got some idea of your exports . i'm interested in your silk blouses .
our silk is known for its good quality . it is one of our trade - trional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . they've met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .
i think it should be casual .
i agree . next , we have to decide on food . we have a choice of chinese or continental cuisine . which one should we have ?
i would prefer chinese food for this party .
perfect choice . for music , should we have a live band or a dj ?
i think we should hire a live band .
ok then . well , i will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on friday .
i need job security .
would you be able to relocate ?
i am open to relocating .
what are your annual salary requirements ?
i need at least 75 ,000 per year .
i'll keep that in mind . thank you for coming in today . we'll be in touch .
that's right . just a simple multi - vitamin that i can take every day .
okay . then i recommend this one . it's made especially for men about your age .
oh ! you took the guesswork right out of that one .
that's my job ! is there anything else i can assist you with ?
do you have any product that controls frizz ?
with the cut i'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that .
thank you !
and when we're done , i'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest .
oh , come on , they give them treat too . oh , look , that little monkey is so cute .
cute ? hope so .
oh , it is coming to us , come on , ben , get a banana to it .
me ? no way , keep him away from me , please .
why are you acting so strange today ?
i've said that i've got a problem with the circus . i'm not kidding .
that's weird !
later we'll let you know who the king and queen of the reunion will be .
but for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . get out on that dance floor !
uh - huh .
then , walk three blocks to second avenue an turn right . are you with me so far ?
yes . i'm following you .
then , walk two more blocks an you'll see city hall on the left . have you got all that ?
yes . now i've got it . thank you very much .
i wanted to see if you wanted to come .
this friday ? sorry , i already have plans .
doing what ?
i'm going to dinner with my family .
i really wanted you to come , but i understand .
yeah , maybe next time .
i'll hold you to that .
sounds like a plan .
it's true .
call transfer has many other advantages . when i am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , i also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand - free telephone and i will not miss any call .
that's all ?
in hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip - ment , so we must close our handsets . if you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .
i don't understand why .
i'm going to have to keep your deposit
why can't i have it back ?
because you're leaving before your lease is over .
you have to give it back to me .
you're not going to get it .
but i'm not able to live here anymore .
i can't help you with that .
thank you .
wait ! congratulations ! you are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration .
wow , it's surprising . so what do i get ?
you can have a free facial and then make up free for you . do you want it now ?
probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i can't afford now .
here is our number . call us when you are ready to come .
you mean i should make an appointment ahead of time ?
yes .
got it . bye for now .
which anti - virus program would you recommend ?
have you tried this one ? it's very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?
just a minute . . . go to this one . i'll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .
what do you use your computer for ?
i use it for several things - surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . i don't play many games on my computer , but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program , you
computers are great , aren't they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them .
a : : so , wily , you have been with ibm for two years , ready for change ?
b : : well , i think i'm ready for new challenges .
what are your rates ?
it is rib 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .
i have a lot of luggage . will those fit in the taxi ?
take it easy . i'll send a larger to pick you up .
thank you very much .
no problem at all , mr waterstone . any preference as to how you want the money ?
anything you like , but not too many large notes . it's useful to have smaller notes .
here we go , mr waterstone . here's your money and your interest note .
yes , yes . everything's fine . thank you very much , becky .
here you are . and here are three crash helmets .
thanks . well , those two kids are beginners . what should i do about their safety ?
well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . first , make sure they don't go far from the railings .
oh , yeah , maybe i should ask them just to walk along the railings .
that's a good idea . and remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .
ok . anything else ?
never go to the center of the lake . the ice there is too thin to skate on .
got it . thanks for reminding me . and , are there any intensive training courses ?
but it's true .
how can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ?
that's coincident .
ok , hold it . remember to be punctual next time .
i promise i will .
you'd better .
two air tickets .
air tickets ?
yes . we will fly to paris the day after tomorrow .
we ? the day after tomorrow ? what are you talking about ?
today is june 18 , isn't it ?
yes . so ?
think about it !
then it is june 20 the day after tomorrow .
yes . think about it carefully .
oh , come on . tell me please . why did you book tickets to paris ?
oh , honey ! don't you remember this important day to us ?
sorry .
it is our 10th wedding anniversary this june 20 .
our 10th wedding anniversary ?
of course . you completely forgot it .
darling . i think you have made a mistake .
i have made a mistake ?
yes . we married on july 20 ten years ago .
july 20 ? but i think it should be june 20 .
yes . we had planned to marry on june 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day .
yes . i remember now . we put it off . i did make a mistake . but how shall we deal with the tickets ?
since you have booked . then let's celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand .
not long , because people rush for lunch .
the line sure does move fast .
tell the man behind the counter what you want .
ok . i like that green vegetable but i don't know how to call it .
just point to it if you don't know the name .
all right .
yeah , so are you planning on going ?
i think so . it sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun .
it really does , i can't wait .
what time does the party start ?
it starts at 8 o'clock .
oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ?
i'm not sure , but i don't think she's given out that many .
well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today .
cool ! also amongst the winners is petra , in jordan , mach pitch in peru and the pyramid in chichenitza in mexico .
wait a minute ! it also says that the christ re - deemer statue in brazil and the colosseum in rome are wonders . i would love to go to italy and see the colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator !
well , let's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year .
good idea !
i'm planning to visit new york from friday , april 14 until monday , april 17 .
our room rates recently went up . is that okay with you , mr . sandals ?
how much per night are we talking about ?
each night will be $ 308 .
that price is perfectly acceptable .
wonderful ! do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ?
nonsmoking , please .
next question , is a queen - size bed okay ?
that sounds fine .
okay , mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number .
certainly . my phone number is 626 - 555 - 1739 .
thank you , mr . sandals . we look forward to seeing you in new york !
great ! would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ?
no , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . oh , and make it thin crust .
okay , thin crust . your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it's free !
perfect . thank you . bye . .
wait ! ! i need your address !
it says it's located in the suburbs .
well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices .
in that case , let me have a glass of orange juice .
anything else ?
i would like to have some tea as well .
another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .
i see .
i'm afraid not .
in that case i highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . that would help with your credit card application .
what is the interest rate on your card ?
the annual charge rate is 9 . 5 % .
that's very expensive !
not really . the credit card is a revolving account . you only pay interest on what you owe .
how does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?
you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .
does the card provide any other benefits ?
you can also get a cash advance up to 1 ,000 dollars on this card .
wow ! how often do you exercise like that ?
about five times a week . what about you ?
oh , i hardly ever exercise . i usually just watch tv in my free time . i guess i'm a real couch potato !
here's my name card .
and here's mine .
it's nice to finally meet you .
and i'm glad to meet you , too .
sorry , i am not sure . can i take a message ?
no , thanks . i will call back later .
that's fine . please call again later .
ok . thank you . goodbye .
all right , can i have your passbook ?
yes , here you go .
what amounts do you want the checks in ?
it's all the same to me .
here you are .
thanks .
just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .
did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?
everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .
are you going to be home so i can come by and take a look at the problem ?
i am not sure if i will be home later .
i will be coming by around 10 this morning . if you aren't there , i'll just use my key .
oh , my god , three hours already ! i have to get the chores done !
no time . that's their headlights in the window !
ok , emergency measures . let's throw the dishes in the trash ! two birds with one stone . . .
little dude , your life is over !
no time to worry . we have to dispose of this evidence .
he's fine . he retired last week . it's a turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .
oh , i don't think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .
so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !
how do you want to spend your old age ?
in the same way , probably .
it's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if i am a well - rounded person by looking at it ?
well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . that's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .
of course . we will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business .
it's too small for me to wear .
would you like another bigger one ?
no thanks . i want to have a refund .
ok , here is your money .
may i try it on ?
go ahead .
is there a mirror around here ?
right over there .
does it suit me ?
yes , you look very nice .
how much is it ?
we're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .
that's quite reasonable .
what do you need to take it for ?
i'm trying to get my license .
you need six hours .
can i do all six hours in one day ?
you have to do it in three days .
that's all i have to do ?
that's everything .
well , that's a relief .
i'm afraid so . we found this crack on the bottom when i went back to my hotel .
oh , how awful ! let me have a look , i'm terribly sorry . it was most thoughtless of me . would you excuse me , please ?
oh , it's quite all right , i suppose . it can't be helped sometimes .
it's very kind of you to say so . how about changing another one for you ?
all right . thank you .
just a minute , please . i won't be long . i'm sure this one is perfect . you may examine it carefully .
oh , yes , it is . i'll take this one .
i'm very sorry for any inconvenience i've caused you .
well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .
yes , we have some chinese medicine for common cold .
i heard chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .
it depends . it's true that you can take some for prevention .
i don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
good point . ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
how much do you think the rent will be ?
i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .
can you fill it ?
i'm afraid not . the tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .
then i might as well have it done now .
you'd better wait , the gums are swollen . take the medicine i prescribe and come back in three days .
what do landlords charge for rent ?
would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?
there are two of us , but we only need a one - bedroom apartment .
you should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .
i really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .
sure , i'll go look at apartments with you anytime you want .
model of computers aren't compatible ?
most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .
maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .
but by then , the technology will be outdated .
true , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .
that's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .
this model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top - quality product .
i guess you get what you pay for .
no , no . i've got plenty left .
now i'm confused again ! what is the problem ?
what am i going to do about souvenirs ?
oh , i get it ! you want souvenirs !
yes , i've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
please ! free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
i understand completely , sir . housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
what's the problem ?
i wrote the check out for way too much .
how much ?
i wrote the check out for $ 150 .
what were you supposed to write it out for ?
i was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .
i'll just cancel it for you right now .
that's great . you're a lifesaver .
the suitcase , that's all . except my handbag . of course .
would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? you needn't weigh your handbag .
is there a receipt ?
yes . i'll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket .
what must i do next ?
you must go to immigration to the departure lounge .
don't you have the exams coming up soon ? i'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .
oh , i nearly forgot the exams .
you do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . am i right ?
yeah , i guess so . maybe i can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .
an excellent idea . work now and play later .
i know you're right . school is more important than tv . can i watch one more show , then go to bed .
no , now it's bedtime .
last week , madam ? i really can't remember which ones you mean . what were they like ?
oh , they were lovely . sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country - style you know , and the lids , if i remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?
that's strange . i don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . are you sure they were in this shop ?
oh , you must know the ones i mean . they were on sale , a real bargain . reduced to a quarter of the original price . i couldn't believe my eyes when i saw them .
i am afraid the sales are over now , madam . and you know we all sold out of the saucepans .
i don't think you did , you know . my neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .
well , it's all new stock in the window now .
may i just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?
eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .
yes , yes , i am sorry i won't keep you . it must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . but they were such beautiful saucepans . i'd have bought them if i had made up my mind on the spot .
perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , i could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . and there are still one or two things at the sale price .
oh , look ! that was the one there . that is the sort of thing i was looking for . but it's not quite the color .
that might be the artificial lighting , madam . of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it's exactly what you are looking for .
there it is . that is the pattern ! the set behind you . thank goodness , they haven't been sold . and thank you so much for being so patient with me . yes , those are the ones .
i am afraid i can't agree with you there . i must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .
but you must take the design and quality into consideration . you know we are superior to others in design and quality . we have various styles , which the other companies can not catch up with .
i agree that yours are of the top .
well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?
to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .
impossible . how about 5 % off ?
right . a reduction of 5 % is acceptable .
economy or business class ?
economy , please . how much is it ?
it will be $ 850 .
very good . could i get an electronic ticket ? i'm always afraid of losing my tickets .
no problem . how do you wish to pay for it ?
bank of american card . the number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 .
thank you ! would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ?
an aisle seat , please . i'm tall and need to get up and walk pretty often .
no problem . your ticket is for trans pacific flight 87 from detroit to beijing at 3 forty p . m . on april 13 . you will arrive at beijing international airport at six 35 p . m . on april 14 . your electronic
what time should i arrive at detroit airport ?
please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . you also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure .
what happens if i can't leave on april 13 ? can i cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?
yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .
that's ok . what are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?
on trans pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds .
that's great ! i can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . i think i'm all set . you're really efficient . thank you very much for your help .
thank you for the compliment and for calling g . o . t . travel agency . have a nice trip !
ok , i will get one for your . here you are .
but it is too loose . do you have the smaller size ?
sorry , it had been sold out .
what a pity !
what's the current interest rate ?
our monthly interest is 1 . 5 % of the outstanding balance . would you please fill out the application the form ?
model it for me .
ok !
wow ! you look just as dorky as dilbert !
a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .
but how will you know how much i should pay ? i mean , i receive my bills , not you .
we set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
i see . so , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? that does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .
sure . what's your number , please .
519 367 8901 .
thanks . and your name is tony , right ?
yes . i'm tony . thank you very much .
you're welcome . bye .
bye .
i bought it for one hundred and forty - five dollars at helen's boutique . i didn't know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
of course ! everything at helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why didn't you shop around ?
i don't know , i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it . i guess i was too impulsive .
that's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .
yes , sometimes the differences are great .
well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .
we have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .
thanks a lot .
oh , yes . how old are you ?
twenty .
hum , still a student ?
yes , i'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics .
what subjects are you studying ?
english , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy .
have you had any working experience .
well , i worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays .
what do you like to do in your spare time ?
i like sports very much . besides that , i also like working on a computer in my spare time .
how are your english and computer skills ?
i have passed the cet - 4 and 6 . as far as computer is concerned i can use the computer for word processing .
okay . mr . liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .
what style do you want ?
i want to buy a v - neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .
oh , i see . how about the color ?
quiet color .
i know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .
really ? let's go there .
i didn't know you were a vegetarian !
i'm not , i am a vegan .
a what ?
a vegan . i don't eat or use any animal based products . i don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .
wow ! that's interesting ! it must be tough !
it's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .
did you think that the food was any good ?
i wasn't all that impressed by the food .
the service certainly could have been better .
the service did not help the situation .
is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ?
i am not interested in trying this restaurant again .
do you have any dutiable items ?
no , i don't .
what are these ?
they are my personal effects .
wouldn't the owners have told me about any problems ?
sellers aren't always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren't aware of .
can i require the owners to fix the problems ?
you can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .
what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?
there were no major problems . one leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that i found .
it depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course .
i need to get my license .
you're going to need to complete six hours .
how many hours a day can i do ?
you can do two hours a day for three days .
that's all i need to do to finish ?
yes , that's all you need to do .
thanks . i'll get back to you .
ok .
please be careful with the suitcase , it's very heavy .
i'll let the bellboy know . don't worry , he's very strong .
and the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too .
of course .
he must have just got online for the first time last week . he still thinks it's some kind of new toy .
your total comes to $ 7 .
here's a twenty . could you give me some more napkins ?
sure . your cash back is $ 13 . and we'll bring out your fries in two minutes .
thanks .
mmmm . . . a photo i . d . i have my new jersey driver's license . is that ok ?
that will do . what an interesting picture ! how old is it ?
actually it wad taken just last year , but i had a shaved head and a beard . can you still recognize me ?
barely . will you be checking any luggage today ?
yes , one suitcase . i also have a carry - on bag .
ok . mr . lee , you're all set . your flight leaves from gate 10 . boarding begins at 10:30
you're right . too much or too little won't do any good .
the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
sounds reasonable .
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
and fruits !
surely it is . getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
i've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can also help one to keep sound physical health .
i think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
you bet it !
then i'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc .
where is the fitting room ?
it's there , near the mirror .
just in case , right ?
right . hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock .
we are checking in . may i have your ticket and your health certificate and your luggage please .
here you are .
are you keeping the small bag as carry - on luggage , sir ?
yes .
you must weigh that as well .
all right .
your luggage is two pounds over . i'm afraid they'll be in excess luggage charge , sir .
how much must i pay ?
it's ten yuan .
here you are .
this is your luggage check which you must show when you disembark at your destination and here is your boarding pass and your ticket .
thanks .
now , please wait until your flight is called . there's about twenty - five minutes to go .
i'm a little nervous . i've never flown before .
there's nothing at all to worry about . once you are in the air , it's just like sitting at your sitting room . it's going to be a very pleasant flight .
there is no need . thanks .
i never bought food from the cafeteria .
you haven't ? they have a lot of good stuff .
what do they have ?
they sell everything .
well , i want chinese food .
i've gotten chow mein from there before .
i guess we can eat there then .
trust me , the food isn't half bad .
put it on channel 5 , ok ?
oh , i hate channel 5 . i'd rather just listen to the radio .
don't make such a fuss . i'm sure you will like today's programme .
what's on today ?
a basketball match between chinese team and american team .
really ? i'm interested in it .
it might begin now .
can i send it in now ?
you should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . if it hasn't been , we will still accept it .
can i mail it in early next time so it isn't late ?
actually , you can not mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .
will my paycheck come right away now ?
your check will arrive a little late .
how do you do ?
it's kind of you to meet me at the airport .
welcome to beijing . is this your first time in china ?
no , i have visited china several times , but it's my first visit to beijing and i think it's a great honor to be invited to your beautiful city .
it's our pleasure to have you here . i hope you will have a pleasant stay here .
thank you . i'm sure i will have a wonderful time here .
how much is it ?
180 yuan , and you can get a free 8 piece gift package .
what's included in the gift package ?
some black mascara , moisturizing orion , eye cream crystal lipstick , a two color eye shadow pack , styling hairspray , and a cosmetics bag .
sounds not bad .
all right , mr . cook . i'll have mr . baker call you back as soon as he gets here .
and when do you get home at night ?
i get home pretty late , around midnight .
so what do you do , exactly ?
i'm a tv announcer . don't you recognize me ? i do the weather report on knt !
gee , i'm sorry . i don't watch tv .
like what ?
oh , he wanted to know what time i got up this morning and if i bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that .
what on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?
i've no idea . oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . he asked me what i had for breakfast this morning .
oh well , that's it . they obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . i should think you'll get thirty years .
hmm . thank you very much .
i see , sir . this one is very good .
is it ?
you may rest assured . it sells well .
may i have a look at the introduction ?
certainly . here it is .
yes , it is . sayuri beds , tokyo , japan .
that's what i want ! do you need me to sign anything ? or fill in some forms ?
just sign right here , please . that's everything you need to do .
perfect . thank you , goodbye !
thanks a lot
you are welcome
it means that we will arrive on the same day .
yes .
if we start early , do we have some time for yuanmingyuan ?
i think so . we can go there in the afternoon if you like .
i don't want anything except a taxi , thank you .
i understand . and where will you be going ?
rockefeller center .
and what time would you like to be picked up ?
the sooner the better .
a taxi will be here shortly , sir .
great ! and remember , a taxi , not a limo .
a taxi it is , sir .
push the red button on the mike to turn it on .
ok . this key is too high for me .
i think it's a piece of cake for you .
ok . let me have a try . . .
well done ! i hope i can sing as well as you one day .
thank you . i'm sure you will .
i hope so . thank you for saying so .
which do you prefer ?
hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .
is there anything else i can do to help with the itching ?
you can take an antihistamine .
thank you so much for all of the information .
you are welcome . please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .
we have a double room for you with a nice view of the park . would that be ok ?
yes , that would be great . how much is the room ?
it is ninety - five pounds per night . it is a double room with a bathroom . there is a fridge , coffee maker and a television in the room .
does the bathroom have a bath or a shower ?
all our bathrooms have full size baths with a shower attachment .
does the room have an internet connection ?
yes , all our rooms have complimentary wireless internet .
excellent . do you serve breakfast in the hotel ?
yes , breakfast is included in the price . our guests have the choice of a full english breakfast or a continental breakfast .
that's great . can i book the room ?
certainly , sir .
thank you .
a little bit . i'll take a look if you want me to .
please . thank you so much for stopping .
yeah , she's hot . radiator's leaking . looks like you were running her pretty hard .
that must have been just before i got the speeding ticket .
did you have an accident recently . . . hey , wait a second ! i know this car !
you do ?
i ran into it a couple of weeks ago . what do you know ? name's hal .
i'm akimbo . nice to meet you , i guess .
boy , i'm sure sorry about your car . hey , akimbo , i wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?
what kind of deal ?
i'd like to give you cash for the damage to your car .
you don't want your insurance company to pay for it ?
i'd rather not . they'll raise my rates . it'll cost me more in the long run .
if you give me cash , do you care if i don't fix the car ?
hell , i don't care . just don't submit a report to your insurancecompany .
it's a deal , hal . thanks again for stopping to help . and thanks for smashing my car !
as a new - comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . and remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave .
will our company have some recreational activities ?
of course . in spring and autumn , we will hold some sports actives . and in movie seasons , we bulk purchase film tickets .
well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ?
it's my rock bottom price . take it or leave it .
when you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . you will get monthly pay and will be on eight - hour / day work shift .
wait , will i have five insurances and one fund ?
yes . you can also enjoy legal holidays and year - end bonus .
it sounds great !
if you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .
ok .
you have read the relevant terms of the contract . do you have other questions ?
how long will the induction training be ?
about two weeks .
i see .
if you don't have other questions , just sign here .
ok .
can i get you anything to drink ? :
yes , i'd like a glass of iced tea .
okay . i'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
thank you .
i'll get the flour out .
let me help you .
then what's your counter - offer ?
this is our counter - offer .
we are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter - offer and our price is too great .
so are we . our counter - offer is in line with the world market .
how about meeting each other half - way in order to conclude the business ?
agreed .
chinese people don't like to eat cold food .
is that right ?
but i'm open to new things . i'll have a bowl of cereal , too .
with cold milk ?
with cold milk !
okay , i'll be down there shortly .
you probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir .
how many seats are there in the stand ?
oh , there are 5000 seats in total .
i didn't know it would be so big !
it is ! look there , those are the tracks . and the jumping pit is over there .
ah . . . i see . hey , look the sign here , no climbing .
we put many signs with english translations for foreign visitors .
oh , great idea !
yes . could you tell many balance ? here's account number .
i'll give you a blood test . would you roll up your sleeve ? just as i thought . you're anemic . you'd better pay more attention to your diet . eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . and don't stay up late working . try to get more rest .
thank you .
more or less . i go to three different buildings , and always get there late . i feel so hopeless . i don't know why i am late all the time . no one else seems to be .
that's because you don't know the short cuts . you'll learn them after a while . i can show you the ropes .
that's lincoln .
what do you like about him ?
he is very intelligent .
you think so ?
that's right . plus , i agree with his policies .
i'm glad to hear that you are so excited .
i'm voting for the next president .
i'm sure he will be .
i'm going to make sure and vote .
that's for the phone calls you made from your room .
can i pay with traveller's cheques ?
certainly . may i have your passport , please ?
here you are .
could you sign each cheque here for me ?
sure .
here are your receipt and your change , sir . thank you .
thank you . goodbye .
what are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?
the only thing i really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . i want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that i have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . i believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .
how do you organize and plan for major projects ?
i love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . then , i set a timetable that's realistic . what i usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because i've already visualized what could happen and how i'd react .
describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .
i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was on the road for two consecutive weeks . the amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because i could't bring my office files with me . luckily i had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .
how do you manage your time in a typical day ?
i've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . the last thing i do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which i take care of at the end of the day or week .
describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .
i changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .
it's worth a shot . maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .
he shouldn't drive his car . he should come here by bus .
okay . i could go for that . it's called al's steakhouse . they also have great fried fish , and i love their salad bar . you can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .
is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?
yes , their steaks are enormous . sometimes i can't finish what i've ordered .
what if that happens to me ? i hate to let food go to waste .
don't worry . we'll just get a doggie bag .
definitely !
if that information is exact , i guess our company is willing to promote someone .
alright , give me the number . but put me on that waiting list as well .
here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .
how many people are on the waiting list right now ?
right now i show that there are 176 people on the list . and you are number 176 .
yes , it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .
it's so small . the fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .
have you ever listened to am radio ? it's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on tv and fm radio .
i don't remember the last time i listened to am radio .
another place you can get real insight is european papers . you can get them on - line .
sure . do you have my number ?
yes , i have it right here . i'm so sorry about this .
no problem . i'll wait for your call .
great ! do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?
i didn't just find out about one job . there were several ones that looked good .
maybe i should try looking on the web for work .
sure you have to be patient . but i think it's much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .
but there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . you might have no chance .
how do you know if you don't have a try ?
thanks . what kind of stone is this ?
it's a ruby . it is from south africa . would you like to try it on ?
yes , please . how much is it ?
it costs $ 200 .
it looks good . ok . i'll take it .
i'm very glad to hear that .
come here , let me introduce some friends to you .
it sounds like you are coming down with the flu . let me take your temperature .
have i got a high fever ?
yes , thirty - eight point seven . do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?
yes , i have .
now , let me have a look at you . i'd like to listen to your chest . now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it cough , now again . i want to examine your throat , too . open wide , say'ah - - '
aaaaahh , aaaaahh .
yes , it does look a bit sore . let's take an x - ray of your chest and give you a few tests .
all right , thanks .
the tests showed nothing wrong . a slight viral infection .
what shall i do today ?
i'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . here's the prescription .
it's not too much , only about $ 85 .
plus installation ?
no , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .
really ?
yes , it's just a couple of screws .
that's nice .
it's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .
if my hard drive crashes , i'll just call you .
yes . we come at the right time .
yes , you may consider those two places also . seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called museum of flight .
and seattle is the home of microsoft and boeing . that must be a great place . i can't miss it .
this home is gorgeous on the inside !
everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .
the wall colors totally suit the style of this house .
straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .
i love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .
the master suite is the best . let's go look at that next .
there is plenty of room for our king - sized bed , and i love the light in this room .
i know that you like this house , but let's take a look at the others before you make up your mind .
will that be first class or economy seat ?
what's the fare for a first class seat ?
$ 200 .
oh . i am not a wall streeter . give me an economy one please .
yes . and if you already have a current account with us , the insurance premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .
yes , there has been a lot of research into rsi's . something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?
yes , i noticed that you have professional training and team - building days . i like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .
well , welcome to the team .
certainly , sir .
certainly !
please ask her to call john .
it should be the way out .
ok . let's go and see .
my parents are taking me to dinner tonight .
could you go with me to the movies on friday night , instead ?
what movie did you want to see ?
there is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .
i was thinking that i would like to see " the secret life of bees . "
oh great ! sounds like something i need to bring kleenex to !
hey ! i'm the tour guide . i'll take care of the taiwanese guests .
you're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means . . .
i will . don't worry !
nonsense . there's lots of food in the refrigerator . . . what's behind your back ?
nothing .
what are you hiding behind your back ? let me see .
promise that you won't get angry .
ok , i promise . what is it ?
it's a kitty .
oh , jim . i told you . no pets . it'll make a mess of this house .
please , mummy . everybody else in my class keeps a pet . please , i'll take care of it . it's a good kitty . it'll not bring you any trouble .
no way . it might belong to somebody else . you can't keep it here .
please , mummy . i found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . it was starving and looking for something to eat . please ! you see , it's so cute and tame .
all right . but you have to clean up everything it messes up .
i will . thank you , mummy .
what words do i need to know to buy a pair of shoes ?
you need to know the type of shoes you want .
don't worry about that . i can point it out in the store .
the shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . in girls shoes , the heel can be high or low .
let me write all that down . i'm going shopping this afternoon .
all right . we can grant a financing promise quota , if you qualify . this means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . firstly , your credit rating must be class a , and your debt to asset ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in .
all right . that sounds like fun .
correct . show respect for the older people . conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .
any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
yes , plenty of them . don't eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .
is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
haha , i'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .
i think the only thing is toner . try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . we should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .
ok , will do .
oh , i like the color .
i'm afraid all the big tables are taken .
will i be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?
yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .
how will i know what the numbers mean ?
you can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
how can i see test results from tests i have taken before ?
we put all of your test results up in the same place . just check the dates for what you need .
what's your proposal ?
your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . well , i suggest we meet each other halfway .
do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that's impossible !
what would you suggest ?
the best we can do is another 30 dollars off . that's definitely the lowest we can go .
that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . let's meet each other half - away again and split the difference ; i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
ok . we can meet halfway again .
b as in boy . you should get off at the last stop in chinatown .
oh , you mean canal street ?
that's the wrong direction . canal street is on the other side of chinatown .
oh , i get it . when did we decide to meet ?
at 10 ,45 . is ann coming along ?
i can not get hold of her yet .
see you around , carl .
see you later .
what happens if you exceed the limits ?
we try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .
how much do you like to exchange ?
20 ,000 rib .
in what denominations ?
it doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .
right , i will exchange for you now . please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone .
well , could you change them too ? the dollars , i want to change them into swiss francs .
ok , wait for a moment . well , i am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . in this case , you'd better change 2 ,000 $ to swiss francs .
it doesn't matter .
please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .
thanks a lot . good - bye .
i am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .
signing the registry is a good idea . i think i want to see the kitchen next .
i really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day .
i need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it .
is the current asking price listed on the flyer ?
the asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty - five thousand dollars .
isn't this the car store ?
no . it's mike's sporting goods .
oh , sorry . do you know the number for a car store , then ?
no . i don't . i suggest you look in the phone book .
i'm sorry to have bothered you .
no problem .
it was for 10
i am looking at your appointment right now . what day would you prefer ?
i would prefer next thursday .
what time would be best for you ?
i want to come in at 2
i am writing you down for that time . we look forward to seeing you .
you can't be serious .
that's how much this t . v costs .
that's too expensive for me .
this television is of very high quality .
you can't go down on the price .
by how much ?
i'll buy it for $ 2000 .
i'm sorry , but the price is final .
our sniffer dog seems to disagree . do you mind if we look in your suitcase ?
not at all . go right ahead .
what's this sir ?
it's traditional chinese medicine . i mix it with hot water like tea . sorry . i forgot about it .
what are these red things sir ?
oh no ! i forgot about those too ! those are chinese sausages for my aunt lily .
i'm sorry sir , but you can't take any of this into the country . we will also have to check your carry - on . please step this way . don't'be nervous ; we'll just look through it briefly and then
i am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . i have to consider your mother's life .
oh , i see . do you advise me to buy one ?
you have children now . what if something , god forbid , happens to you ?
that's true . well , how much do you think i should get ?
a $ 100 000 policy shouldn't be too expensive . here , call my agent . he'll give you a good deal .
pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self - cultivation . good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable .
how can i have the good external expressions ?
don't worry about that . you just pay more attention to the details of people's action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language .
yeah , yeah , i know what i selected . just gimme my money !
please type the amount you would like to withdraw . thank you , you want to transfer 10000 usd to the world wildlife foundation . if this is correct please press 1 .
no , no ! stupid machine , what are you doing ! no !
confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye !
no , no way ! what happened ? give me my money !
danger , danger ! the exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked in until the local authorities arrive . thank you for using our bank . have a nice day .
i need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .
ok . what about going to the movies on friday night ?
what were you planning on seeing ?
i was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .
how about " the secret life of bees " ?
that's a chick flick !
here is your valuable . is that right ?
yes , thank you .
no , i think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america .
religious people blame it on pre - marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .
what do you think about abortion ?
i personally would never want to have one , but i think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?
i know this is going to sound sexist , but i don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .
why not ? it's their children , too .
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .
that might be true , but i think men should have some kind of say in the matter .
you say that now , lily , but you'll thank me later . i'm your mom , and mother knows best .
i'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision .
how much do apartments cost around here ?
it depends on what you want . do you want a one - or two - bedroom apartment ?
i just need a one - bedroom apartment .
that will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .
would you come with me to look at apartments ?
i would be happy to look at apartments with you .
i thought you knew .
i honestly didn't know .
the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .
that's good to hear .
will you go and visit them ?
of course i will .
i just wanted to give you the good news .
thanks for letting me know .
maybe the situation is too urgent .
yes , i think i should have jumped in any case .
those are the only things you eat ?
that's basically what i eat .
why aren't you eating anything else ?
well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .
and the chicken ?
it's really healthy to eat when you bake it .
i guess that does sound a lot healthier .
today is my first day at work !
well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! just ask me if you need any help .
thank you . it's very kind of you .
you are welcome .
what qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
i think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
what was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
the most important thing i learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities . advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . if i want to make in marking in advertising industry , i can't stop studying and creating .
i know a very interesting place .
oh , do you ? good .
i'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what's keeping him .
looks like he won't show up . he's done this before , hasn't he ?
yeah , a number of times .
what's he trying to pull anyway .
i don't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok , let's go in , sandy .
turn on the air conditioner .
it doesn't work .
what happened ?
i don't know .
did you call the repairman ?
of course .
when is he coming ?
he's busy . he said next week .
would you like another beer ?
i'll have another cup of beer insist . i know i don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .
come on , it's the weekend . let's taste and enjoy this meal . cheers !
bottom's up , and you're right . this meal is incredible . i wish i had known this restaurant before . thanks for bringing me here . i know i'll be back agile soon .
what's the matter
i'm a little worried about my host family . you know , in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .
is it easy to learn ?
yes . it is i can teach you if you like .
thank you . i can teach you how to bowl .
right . let's help each other .
all right . ask me a question now .
who invented the electric light bulb ?
that's easy . it was invented by edison .
correct . now for a harder question . who will be the first men on mars ?
i can't answer that . but i think mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .
ask me a question now .
all right . what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
that's easy . it's . . er . venus . no . pluto . no . wait a minute . it's anthe tip of my tongue . oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?
what does it say ?
this is an especially famous one . it says " may the passing days bring you health and longevity . may this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "
that's very nice . is it for sale ?
no . i never sell my artwork .
really ? then what do you do with it ?
i give it away . here , this one is for you .
wow ! really ? are you sure ? now i'll have a lucky year !
remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it can not be given or taken away . . .
definitely not . the most important thing was we loved each other .
well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .
all superstitious nonsense ! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .
i'm sorry . it's out of stock now . could you come by again next week ?
next week ? it is too late . i need it urgently .
well , then , is it convenient to leave your phone number so that i can inform you as soon as we restock it ?
no , thanks any way .
you're welcome .
guangzhou . i've got a cousin there .
it's about a girl . no , an angel ! i'm going to the coffee shop where she works right now .
our reservation number is j - 221 .
let me see . oh , yes , we have your reservation number .
you mean you haven't arranged any car ?
i'm sorry to say no .
here i'll take taxi instead , how do you refund us ?
that is the pump you are in front of .
is it expensive ?
it is the most expensive .
well , i don't want it then . can i move to another pump ?
yes , i can give you regular unleaded . but you have to back up the car a little .
give me regular unleaded then . i will back up . can you wash my windows for me ?
i'm sorry , sir . this is not a full service gas station . i will help you fill the gas , but we don't wash windows here .
really ? well , i guess i have to get used to it .
mary , can i get josh or you something to drink ?
oh no , thank you . we aren't all that thirsty .
how about a little snack then ?
no , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago .
well then , how is your family ?
everyone is doing great . my sister finally had her baby .
so find a guy to marry and you can get one !
i don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !
oh , i see . you're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .
it's very simple actually . you can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . they will give you a call if any job comes up .
good . i'll do it .
no wonder people say
quick ! pass me your binoculars . look at that bird . . . i've never seen one of those before . it's indigenous to guiling , and an endangered species too . this is lucky !
i didn't know you liked bird - watching .
i don't really . i just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . this place is full of it .
some game ! you try being tackled by ten kids at once !
um , holly ? look behind you . they're coming this way .
oh , where to start ? there have been ups and downs . i'm still trying to find my place in this world . it's only recently that i've been able to start settling down . how about you ? you still with jenn
yeah , jenny and i got married right after graduation . it was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . i was supporting us both while she continued her studies . but now things are getting better
oh , that sounds wonderful . i have always known you two would make it . i hope i can keep in better contact with you guys . i don't want us to drift apart again .
definitely ! actually , we just moved into a new place . there's a house - warming party this saturday , if you are free ? i know jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .
sounds great ! i'll be there .
i've been packed for a week . all my stuff is in this backpack .
let me see . . . two books . . . birdseed ?
that's trail mix !
same difference . what's this ?
and we have some squabbles on some boring things .
this is ordinary marriage life .
have you talk to him about it ?
not yet , but i have to soon . he's eating me out of house and home . i caught him reading the fridge again last night
ahahah , maybe that will help you lose weight .
this is no laughing matter , nick .
sorry paul . i couldn't help it . so why doesn't he give you a hand ?
he watch the tob too much . now really i don't know . but i can't handle this much longer .
well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , ok ?
no , i don't like museums . they're boring .
why don't you go to see the empire state building ?
ah ! that sounds interesting .
yes , that's what i need .
he is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . are you willing to study hard ?
yes , i guess so .
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?
yes , i had a teacher like that before .
did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ?
no , i didn't , but that could be a good thing .
well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . good luck !
the doctors and the nurses will help you . and i will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .
thank you , dear . i feel better now .
i saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .
that sucks so much . what are we going to do ?
i'm getting pretty bored . we should do something despite the rain .
i'm with you . what do you have in mind ?
i haven't been to the mall in a long time . let's go there .
that sounds good . they have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .
great . i'll stop by your place now .
ok . don't forget to bring your umbrella . the rain can start up again anytime .
he's the love of my life ! i've really messed this up .
come on , hon . pull yourself together . it's going to be alright .
but i . . . i still love him ! and it's all my fault ! i can't believe how immature and selfish i was being . i mean , he is a firefighter , it's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . i've totally messed this up !
you know what , veronica , i think you should make the first step . i'm sure he'll forgive you . . .
no , this is not gon na happen ! i . . . i've ruined everything . . .
do you hear something ?
wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?
yeah ! i signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! you fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .
that is kind of weird ! what if she is a psycho or something like that ?
it's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! i am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! i think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .
i guess it does seem logical . i'll have to check it out !
it has been a pleasure . goodbye .
goodbye . thank you again for coming .
you know i work with my professional knowledge not passion . sometimes i don't know what the meaning of working is ?
but you did a good job . you always perform the best in our company .
yes , that's in the past . maybe i need to go to my psychologist for help .
perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .
i was full of ambitions before . but now i have no aim for my career .
maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .
that sounds interesting . but i don't know how to do that .
how about a training course ?
a training course ? that must be costly .
but it's worth it . maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .
ok , let's have a try .
ok .
yes , i liked it , too . it was exciting , but not over the top . do you know what i mean ?
mmm . that's what i thought too . i really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . and i always enjoy watching pierce brosnan .
oh , yes . he's brilliant . did you like the title song ?
not as much as last time , actually . what's the name of the american actor who was in the supporting role ?
hum , edward norton , or something like that . did you like him ?
yes . he was excellent . they worked well together , don't you think ?
i don't know . i think the woman was better . she provided a good love interest . lucky james bond !
yes !
you can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .
i have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .
in order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .
can you recommend some to me ?
certainly . realplayer is a good .
can i download it ?
yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .
i'll try it tonight .
but , you were born and raised in california !
yeah , but i get that sometimes . it doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the u . s . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .
what a racist ! how can you stand working with the guy ?
you know , richard isn't such a bad guy . he made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .
so , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn english ?
i told him 28 years . and , he knows i'm 28 years old since i just celebrated my birthday last week . he was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .
are you sure he really got the message ?
yeah , i'm pretty sure since i then asked him how long it took him to learn english .
that's hilarious ! what did he say ?
he said ,'36 years ,'and we both laughed about it . he apologized and now , it's all good .
i'm glad . i bet he won't make that mistake again .
there is a wait for the computers .
that's all right .
you need to print your name on this list .
okay . now what ?
once a computer is available , i will let you know .
how am i supposed to log on to the computer ?
all you do is type in the number on the back of your card .
that's it ? thank you very much .
thank you . also , we'd like to do some sightseeing while we're in town . can you recommend some local attractions ?
how old are your children ?
i have a 10 - year - old boy and a 6 - year - old girl .
i would recommend a day at the zoo . it's fun for all the family . there is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip .
it sounds marvelous . thank you for your help .
yeah , what's up with that ?
the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . hide away , yi - jun !
no , no , no . i'm not interested in literature .
ok , do you know the title of the book ?
oh , sorry . i'm always absent - minded . i remember that i've put a note in my pocket .
so , show me the note please .
i can't find it now .
oh , such bad luck , sir . can you please name the category of the book ?
let me see . it's not fiction . it's biography .
ok , i'll search it for you . a moment , please .
thanks .
how can we keep track of our grades ?
the final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent .
what if we can't get to school ?
you can only miss one class without penalty .
if we have a major problem , will you let us know ?
i will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem .
these books were due two weeks ago .
yeah . i totally forgot they were due .
you will need to pay late fees on these books .
how much are the late fees ?
the fee is 25 cents every day .
i have to pay 25 cents a day ?
and that's for each book that is late .
that shouldn't be a problem .
try kicking your legs more . that's good . don't go out too far !
it's fine . jump in !
kathy ! get back here ! i see a shark !
ahahah ! ! ! help me ! help ! bring the boat closer ! the shark is coming straight towards me !
it's right under you ! kathy ! ! !
i'll say the movie's starting in the minute .
i know . i wonder what's keeping him .
looks like he won't show up . he's done this before , hasn't he ?
yeah , a number of times .
what's he trying to pull anyway .
i don't know . but this is definitely the last straw .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .
you said it . ok , let's go in , sandy .
and , who is sponsoring your trip ?
my brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . i will stay with him and his family in their home .
alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country .
well , i own a house . actually , i'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors . i have a car at home , and oh , my job ! i'm employed by tornal as an engineer . actually , i only have three weeks'vacation , so i have to go back to work at the end of march .
and what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ?
well , i do have assets in my country . like i said , i own a house , and see , here's a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance .
i'm sorry , sir , we can not grant you a b2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! you win ! congratulations !
first of all , we'll design a custom - made work - out plan according to your habits .
how can you get that done ?
well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . and he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work - out plan for your needs .
what else ?
since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .
sounds pretty good . what about the charge ?
that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .
maybe one month . just have a try first . not too tough at the beginning .
wise decision . you'll find it's totally worth it .
no . i'm a sophomore . i take it you are a new student ?
yeah . it's pretty exciting to be here .
have fun while it lasts . the excitement wears off real quick . especially after you see how much homework you get . where are you from ?
i'm from korea . my parents wanted me to go to an american university , so i came here .
i have never been to korea . i've been to japan before , but never korea .
why were you in japan ?
my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . he's so into learning about different cultures .
that's pretty cool .
i thought it would have been more fun if i went without my parents .
well , if you ever want to visit korea , i would be happy to show you around .
thanks for the offer . i'll keep that in mind . oh , the professor is coming . we'll talk more after class .
ok .
i think i must report to the cops .
ok .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn't it hideous ?
i guess .
are you even listening ? i'm trying to have a conversation with you .
and i'm trying to watch the game , but you're yapping on about your new clothes !
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first !
oh , your precious game . you watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !
oh no you didn't . you didn't just insult the sals - bury seals , did you ? why don't you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !
it must have really hurt afterwards .
well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . i wasn't permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . that was the worse thing .
i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .
i certainly was ! however , the doctor gave me a list of food i couldn't eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !
is there any pain now ?
no , not at all . i stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .
did they take good care of you in the hospital ?
oh , yes . the nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what i could drink . in the end , i just drank water and nothing else . everyone was very professional and i actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .
go ahead . it's nothing serious . we are good friends , aren't we ?
yes , of course . but i'm afraid i can't tell you .
thank you .
since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter , your fortunes are falling . bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . be careful .
that sounds bad ! i'm really worried , what should i do ? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day .
but we have a date tonight ! you can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .
nothing . just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . we'll bring everything .
yes , i do . i know a place that has excellent food .
ok . i'll be happy to join you .
you speak really well .
thank you .
how long have you been in the u . s . ?
3 weeks .
is your wife with you ?
yes , she just got here yesterday .
have you been to california before ?
no . i've never been there .
have you ever been to las vegas ?
yes . i went there once on a business trip .
what can i do for you ?
i am looking for an article in a newspaper .
did you check the periodicals ?
i didn't even bother to think of that .
i'll show you where to find your article .
i get lost in this library .
it's right this way .
thanks a lot for your help .
i'm afraid i can't before i finish this project .
you'd better pay more attention to your health .
i will , thanks for your concern .
you're welcome .
it was the police wo helped me to do that .
it must have taught you a lesson this time .
i am not running after the fashion . i just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .
thank you for your compliments . it sounds like you're a clothing expert .
well , compared with my wife , i'm just a beginner .
we don't have a national day .
really ? that's unusual .
i guess it is . most countries have on , but we don't .
actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . in the evening , many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day .
how about your mother ?
my mother died two years ago .
oh , i am sorry to hear that . is your father still working ?
no , he's retired .
do you have any family here ?
yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .
do you have any brothers or sisters ?
yes , i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .
do you see them a lot ?
not as much as i'd like to . usually just on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas .
oh , cheer up . he'll understand you .
i hope so .
i don't know . a friend of mine said i should try it .
do you know where a moroccan restaurant is ?
as a matter of fact , he gave me this address .
let's go there for lunch ! i'm up for an adventure !
no . it was the only dish she wasn't good at . so we could use you as the new head chef . . .
oh , uncle giovanni . that's wonderful ! thank you ! thank you !
ok , ok . get back to work . there's someone waiting for you in the kitchen . . .
no , i don't think so . she said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .
what a shame ! their marriage is really a mistake .
but you look quite proficient in using them now .
certainly . after all , i've been here for two years . it's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils . though , i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a ch
yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm i
anything strang about that ?
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .
oh , sorry ! there's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .
i agree .
this city is full of jerks .
rude people are everywhere .
but what can you do ?
you can yell at them .
and they will yell back at you .
yelling doesn't do any good .
no . the best thing to do is just stay home .
well , what's the weather report ?
sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow .
did they find those bank robbers ?
not yet . they were holding two men in ohio , but they let them go . they weren't the criminals after all .
what about the sports page ? what were the scores of last night's games ?
here's the paper ; you can read them yourself .
but your health is more important . believe me !
if boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .
come on . things are not so bad . boys can learn to use the computer through games .
oh , no . as a matter of fact , i haven't danced for a long time .
but i am told that you dance wonderfully well .
thanks for flattering me . i think you dance a lot , right ?
no . just occasionally .
what's your favorite dance ?
it's hard to say , but i do love the foxtrot and waltz .
how about rock'n'roll ?
to tell you the truth , i don't like it . it's too noisy .
and the tango ?
oh , it's really beautiful , but i just can't do it well .
don't be so modest . i'm sure you can do it very well . then i'll meet you at six . is that at all right ?
ok .
great ! i'm your lucky fellow then .
what do you usually do with them ?
we like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .
i'll go by myself then .
i live in my uncle's house . he came here ten years ago .
what do you think of the local accent here ? has it been causing you any problems ?
i think it's just a matter of getting used to it .
i can't agree more .
i'm sorry i was such a grouch . it must've been the weather . when it rains i get depressed .
forget it . i'll see you at 11:30 am .
are you sure ? i thought i said it was my mother .
i don't think so . but it could've been .
well . you can trust me this time . my sister is definitely sick . i'm just coming from the hospital . they say she might even die .
i don't buy your story . try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?
i'll do my best .
just try to be a little more punctual in the future .
i'm working on it . really !
for example ?
well , last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there's just nothing can please her .
no , i can't see that happening . i know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .
it's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .
my mother - in - law used to do the same thing to us . if it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .
you can wear that pretty red dress .
around six pm .
do you need help setting up or anything ? i don't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .
no . thank you . i can handle it , but thanks for the offer .
ok , i will see you then .
great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .
right .
where is the computer center ?
the computer center is on the first floor of the library .
where is the library ?
the library is next to the adminstration building . the adminstration building is over there near the school's main entrance . there are school maps for free in the lobby of the admin .
thank you . i will go get one .
sure . glad to be of service . by the way , my name is mike sullivan . you will see me around a lot . i am running for president of the student government .
well , hi ! my name is eve markowski . i am glad to meet you . with your friendly smile and helpful attitude . i am sure you will win .
thanks you for the encouragement .
you are welcome . i'd better go . goodbye .
have a good day . bye - bye !
ok . the dragon boat festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named quyuan . on that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .
why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?
in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .
it sounds so moving .
$ 200 ? if they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! i had a friend who . . .
what did you watch ?
i saw the sixth sense . i didn't know it was going to be so scary .
i remember that . it was a great movie . but it was definitely scary .
if you're not busy , do you want to come over ? i'm afraid to be alone .
sure . i can come over . what should we do ?
how about if we watch a comedy . i need something to get my mind off the frightening images i have from the sixth sense .
ok . i'll get ready and leave . i'll see you in about 20 minutes .
hurry , ok . it's dark out .
don't worry , nothings going to happen . i'll be there real soon .
ok . see you soon .
i'm sorry . i know it must have come as a great shock .
the viewing was for saying goodbye , and i didn't even get that .
can we walk there ?
it's on the second floor . may i join you ?
of course ! let's go .
let's hurry . i'm starving !
maybe he is on the way home now .
the couple with the dogs , think back .
no , i don't recall a thing about them .
well , i've invited them for brunch .
hmm , i must be getting absent - minded .
what a bummer ! you set me up ?
let me explain . i didn't mean to hurt you . . .
some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . do you know how jackie chan measures his worth ?
he measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . by the way , can you count the breaks ?
sure . his skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul - der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . as he said'everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '
indeed you know much about him .
this is because he is the action - movie incarnate or action - star extraordinaire around the world .
ok .
but they're just ads .
duh . . . that's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what's in . plus , there are articles on new trends .
football game ? ok , and you know what comes on next ?
i believe there's a sitcom .
are you interested in watching it ?
let me look in the tv guide first .
oh , i am sorry . what's on channel 2 at 10 pm ?
if i remember correctly , it's a quiz show .
do you want to watch it ?
let's watch it together .
did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?
sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .
you were lucky then . what did you do after that ?
we went for a swim in the sea . that was the best part of the day . just look at my nice tan .
so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .
yes , you're right . and i was so tired that i fell asleep on the way back . my arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .
look . here are the core classes . everyone has to take them .
so i don't have to worry about them .
you're catching on ! however , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics . . .
i'll take home economics .
good . now you can pick classes by yourself .
that's not the gadgets . creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . it engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .
great !
when and where ?
five o'clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ?
yes , i know . i appreciate your invitation .
i am going to invite other guys . see you that day .
see you .
how about your husband . does he help much ?
not at all . he comes home and complains about his hard day at work . he expects me to do everything . he even wants me to feed him sometimes . can you believe that ?
that sucks .
if he wasn't so lazy , i think i wouldn't have any complaints . he mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?
that's crossing the line .
oh well . i'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?
yeah . what's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?
when the olympic games started in modern times , only summer events were included . when it grew popular , there came the winter olympic games , which includes a variety of winter sports .
i see . then , what's your favorite winter sport ?
figure skating . in my eye , nothing beats it .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .
oh , i didn't expect you to know them . but yes , i love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .
that's really a good idea . taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . i recommend you qingdao or dalian .
i've been to qingdao before , so i'll choose dalian . i've heard that the environment there is very good .
yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . last year i went there . it's really .
thank you !
and english is very useful in your job .
i think it will be very useful in many ways . beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in china , but also in the world , english is useful in almost all walks of life .
you will be a very promising one .
that's my wish .
oh , nice . is he coming on his own or with the family ?
his son is coming as well . he wants to go to university here in england so they will visit a few universities while they are here .
does your brother have just one son ?
no , he has two daughters as well . his wife and daughters are visiting her parents . so i won't see them .
i'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .
oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . they went to new zealand last year and loved it .
so when are they all coming ?
my parents are already here . my brother and nephew are arriving on monday .
when did you come to los angeles ?
we moved here when i was fourteen .
did you go to school here ?
well , i went to high school here , but i went to college in texas .
did you get a job right after graduation ?
no , i traveled for a while in europe after college , and then i lived in france .
when was that ?
let's see . . . that was about six years ago .
i bet that was interesting . what did you do there ?
i studied french . anyway . . . that's enough about me . how about you ? were you born in l . a . ?
does your husband feel the same ?
yes . he is very understanding and supportive .
i'm worried that what i say will not make sense .
we could chat about the topic before class . i could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .
that's a good idea . what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic ?
that's easy . express possibilities . people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .
i didn't realize that speaking in class could be so easy .
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . they will reply to your statements , but you can't be sure how .
tom and bill smith . they are both working now you know ? and they've bought a new house .
oh , they have ? i didn't know . i haven't seen tom lately .
it's out in the suburbs .
have you seen the house ?
yes , i have . i went out with them last weekend .
is it nice ?
yes , it is . there are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .
there's also a garden .
well , that does sound nice . have they moved in yet ?
they are moving today . tom's taken the day off . he's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .
when are they going to have the party ?
next saturday night . you should get your invitation today or tomorrow .
wow , that would be something to look forward to .
wonderful ! i think that's a great idea . how soon until we can make this happen ? i can't wait !
tomorrow i have an appointment with my dentist . what about next monday ?
perfect . i'll start preparing tomorrow . if we're going to drive , i'll need to fill up the tank .
no need . i think it's still plenty full . even so , i'd rather travel by bus or train . it would cost much less than driving . oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .
we can take the train , that will be faster . i'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .
great ! oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . i'd hate to get caught in the rain .
no problem . i'm really looking forward to the coming week .
me , too . now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .
yeah , i broke up with lisa . she blew a gasket over it . whoa , get a load of that !
whew ! that getup is terrific !
never mind the getup . she's beautiful !
that too .
i'm gon na introduce myself .
if you're lucky , that might do the trick .
oh , oh , that tears it ! i'm getting out of here .
hold on ! what's the big hurry ?
my ex - girlfriend's here . if she sees me , my goose is cooked .
i wanna finish my drink first . i'll meet you at sammy's .
ok , catch you later .
what about abraham lincoln ? did you get any questions about him ?
i only had 1 question about him . but you might get more . i do nt know if he will have the same exam or not .
hopefully he will use the same exam , cause i m going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
if you ca nt study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .
aright . thanks for the info . i got ta go to the library now .
good luck .
thanks . see ya .
is classical music your favorite ?
yes . what about you ?
i like pop music best . classical music is a bit too heavy for me . i can't get fully relaxed in it .
pop music doesn't have any depth for me .
yeah , that's why i can enjoy myself in it .
did you always like pop music .
i think so , since i was in primary school . how long have you been interested in classical music .
i didn't like it at all until i started to learn violin when i was eight . from then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .
oh , i didn't know you can play the violin . do you still play .
sometimes , but these days i'm often too busy .
sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .
that's crazy .
yes , i am . i am from guangzhou . i am here to study international relations .
how do you like it ?
i like it so far . but my english still needs work .
i want to study mandarin and public relations .
you are right . but what if an avalanche happened ?
they are all great skiers and very experienced . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway , the show is breathtaking . by the way , where did they get so much snow here ?
well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?
it's possible .
some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !
can't beat that ! thank you accounting guy !
the game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .
what are we waiting for ? let's go !
actually , i watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci - fi or a suspense movie . how about you ?
art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .
really impressive . these two genres are totally different .
sure . i enjoy both of them very much .
how often do you go to the cinema ?
once in a while , i suppose , i usually rent movies at movie salon .
movie salon ? where is that ?
it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . i've got a membership there .
is it good ?
yes , you can find almost all new releases there .
really ? maybe i shall also sign up for its membership .
why not ?
three months .
are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?
i want to , but bob doesn't . he wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .
maybe it's more exciting not knowing .
i'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .
there are so many things you have to prepare for .
i know i am going to be busy , but i know i can handle it . i have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .
it really must be an exciting time for you guys .
thank you so much .
what a pity ! you can't join us .
so sorry . next time we'll go , thanks anyway .
ok . i'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .
that's fine . i'll be waiting for you .
see you later .
bye .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .
but i don't think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses .
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .
i'm not sure . i don't enjoy cooking that much . as long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .
you are right . but i just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .
what can you do when this happens ?
not much , usually i'll just keep silent .
but the reservation keeps the car here . that's why you have the reservation .
i know why we have reservations .
i don't think you do . if you did , i'd have a car . see , you know how to take the reservation , you just don't know how to hold the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . anybody can just take them .
but we do have a compact or an suv if you'd like .
fine . i'll take the compact .
alright . we have a blue ford focus for you , mr . fox . would you like insurance ?
yeah , you better give me the insurance , because i am gon na beat the hell out of this car .
what ? what kind of drugs was he using ?
he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
they are . the only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
that's so disappointing . i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
i don't think it's right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
i agree . hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
let's hope so .
in taiwan , prime - time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .
i think americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .
then what about the salary ? would you get more ?
yes , they say i would get a big sum .
have you discussed it with your wife ?
yes , she leaves it to me .
as i say it the work is well worth try . after all you can get a higher salary .
i have to think about it .
what do you think our chance are in other events .
in the last olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . i think we'll do well in those same events .
we might get a gold medal in the sailing too . our team put in a lot of practice .
i think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .
you are very optimistic !
you're a very good player
not really , but once i won a prize .
so did i . i won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .
my prize was for the best player in the country . now let's start playing chess seriously .
got it .
have you ever read this book before ?
no , but my little brother likes it very much .
it's really a good book . you will like it too .
i'll try to read it . actually , i like literature very much .
wow , that sounds like a scholar . by the way , who's your favorite writer ?
jane austen .
me too . pride and prejudice is my favorite .
i like it too . but sense and sensibility is my favorite .
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?
basically , i think tim is threatened by me . i'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !
so he talks about you behind your back ?
yes . he's all nice and friendly to my face . but the second i turn around he stabs me in the back !
i had a worker like that once . she was always taking credit for my ideas .
i should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary i can prove it was my effort .
my co - worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . she liked to name - drop . . . we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday i was chatting with tom . she meant tom solomon . . . our ceo .
i don't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring . he just kept staring at me . he didn't stop .
what did you do ?
i didn't do anything . finally , he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's . but then he came in too .
did he leave when you left ?
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .
what did you do ?
is it close by ?
it's down a block on the right ; can i show you the way ?
ok , i'd love the company .
this will work out well . i'm getting hungry just thinking about it .
you went out and bought khakis , too !
no . mine are a soft brown . yours are khaki .
whatever .
no , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
i don't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years .
well , it's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul .
well . good for him .
that's too bad .
don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . it opens at 8 : 00 .
alright . what do you want to do now ?
let's take a walk for a half an hour . my sister will get here at about 8 : 30pm and then we can all go out to dinner .
where does she live ?
she lives in san francisco .
how long has she lived there ?
i think she's lived there for about 10 years .
that's a long time . where did she live before that ?
san diego .
i read that story too . they seem to be able to understand men .
they sure can . maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .
the park will close soon . we should better go in right now .
really ?
yes , let's go in .
it is a new park , isn't it ?
yes , how do you know ?
i guessed it .
well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
oh , how wonderful !
thank you , mr . johnson .
please , just call me tom .
okay , tom .
where's cindy ?
she's upstairs in my room .
can you tell her to come downstairs ? we're about to have dinner .
no , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .
oh , i don't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years .
well , it's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul .
well . good for him .
ok , let's go .
the competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here .
wonderful , bruce is taking the lead .
other competitors have almost caught up with him . they are neck and neck .
come on , bruce . come on , bruce .
wow , bruce crossed the line first .
in the van .
what about other expenses ?
let's see . gas , food , recreation , we won't spend much . come on . don't hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard , haven't we ?
maybe you're right . when do you plan to go ?
the sooner the better ! i can't wait !
oh , i don't know where we're going yet .
as long as we're going , you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food , so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .
let's go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field !
you have such good ideas !
i will be there half an hour early .
you might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on december 8th . do you have a ride ?
yes , someone is picking me up .
to get back to campus by 8
not at the moment -- maybe later , though .
all of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . see you on monday !
no , in most cases i don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . i work five days a week .
do you enjoy work here ?
it is hard to say . but i've to start by working as a trainee before i really become an experienced marketing assistant . sometimes , i am really under great pressure when it gets busy .
take it easy . i'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . i hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .
luckily not . the silent i meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .
glad to hear that .
it's exciting news ! if we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !
you mean with people on it ?
yes ! isn't that exciting ?
ok . maybe you should invite your sister along , too .
no it's not . it's just funny .
yeah , if you're a girl .
well , you just want to watch dark angel because of the hot girl .
that's not true . dark angel is a good show .
it's story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .
o . k . , o . k . let's forget it . there's a football game on too .
no way . i'm watching ally mcneal . go to john's to watch the game .
what did you buy ?
i bought this coat . do you like it ?
yeah , i like it a lot . it's very pretty . where did you buy it ?
at the mall on 5th street .
was it expensive ?
no , it wasn't expensive . it was on sale for 20 dollars .
that's cheap .
i know . it was a really good deal .
i don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . it's been really hot lately .
really ? what's the matter ?
i don't know . i'm just feeling a little sad .
listen . come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .
now that's a good idea . thanks a lot , brian . i'm feeling better already .
i don't care . i want to burn up my fat .
but running so fast is not good for people over forties .
why ?
we are not as athletic as we were when young . mild exercise is more suitable for us .
but i want to burn up more calories !
in fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .
really ? i will slow down then .
yeah , you are right i used to not watch horror films , but after seeing silence of the lamb with mike last month , i fell in love with them .
it's amazing . but if i were you , i wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .
but it's really exciting .
maybe , but i would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . i wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .
basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .
yep .
i think you should have a try someday . maybe you'll change your mind .
maybe . after all , i am grown up now .
thanks a lot . i'm so touched .
now let me sing " happy birthday " for you .
thank you very much .
well , you look great ! how are you ?
i'm doing really well . i got married about three years ago . i have two kids now .
that's terrific !
that's great !
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
well , you might pinch your eyelid ! or lose an eyeball !
it just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .
well , congratulations . when is the big date ?
in june .
did you have the watch before getting the ring ?
actually , we bought the ring together after i got the watch .
you did a fabulous job with the selection . it's gorgeous .
thank you so much .
what kind of watch is it ?
it's a tag heer .
if you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?
this one is $ 1500 . but they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .
that's why it looks so nice . i should have figured . you always get what you pay for .
yeah . i would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .
come on . for a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . since you're so successful , it must be the latter .
well , you're right . i just broke up with jane .
oh , i'm sorry . i thought you two were made for each ocher .
well , you never know . i'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .
well , she is not to blame . it's always difficult to choose between career and family .
maybe you're right .
jack , i don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !
yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . you know , we were together for almost five years . it's really hard . . .
what is the score ?
china beat brazil three to zero .
wonderful .
ouch .
now he only works freelance . hundred bucks an hour .
perfect . it will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .
will it be an all day event ?
yes . and we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .
that was quick thinking .
isn't that a silly question ? you know how much of an athlete i am .
uh , huh . . . so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?
well , surfing , scuba diving . . .
that's much more convenient . we don't even have to bring the flavorings .
there you go ! daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming .
that's my boy ! katherine curtis created this activity in 1920 . and in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in olympic games .
wow , mom is more knowledgeable than dad . i must learn from you .
my little boy , you should learn more from me . i'm almost thirty years older than you .
ok , you're the boss . look , mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .
oh , my god . it's so dangerous . and he might break his leg . you mustn't do anything like that .
you mean that you can them .
that's right . i can see them in my dreams .
they come to the earth ?
no . their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .
aliens from the outer space ? do you talk to them ? what do they look like ?
ok , ok , one by one , please ! they look like robots , but they can speak . their mission is to make friends with human beings .
that means that you talk to them ? in which language ?
of course in english , they learn english on mars too .
wow . sounds fantastic !
of course not . i just thought the movie was . . . boring .
boring ? come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .
well , i admit . the ghosts were scary .
i like scary movies .
that's gucci's influence . i love science fiction movies !
of course you do . they are silly stories just for little kids like you .
don't call me kid . i am a grownup .
do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?
of course ! i can watch them without you !
oh , really ?
you really are lucky !
yeah , i know .
sorry . i'm strictly a spectator - football , baseball , basketball , golf . . . i watch them all .
what's on ?
paris in the spring .
oh , i've already seen it . i saw it on television last year . it's an old film , but it's very good .
paris is a beautiful city . i have never been there . have you ever been there , ken ?
yes , i have . i was there in april .
paris in the spring , eh ?
it was spring , but the weather was awful . it rained all the time .
just like dear old london !
i want to know what it says .
they didn't accept me .
are you serious ?
it's the truth .
are you okay ?
i really wanted to get into nyu .
i am really sorry to hear that .
it's okay . i'm still waiting to hear from ucla anyway .
i remember my first break up . it was the worst feeling in the world . i was crying everyday for three months . and slowly , it got better . i know you'll feel better too .
you've been through this too ?
yeah . i remember it very clearly . the pain makes it easy to remember . i know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .
but it hurts too much .
i know it's painful , but it's only temporary . after the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .
what if i don't want to find another girl ?
you'll change your mind . look at everyone in the world . they all break up and move on . the faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .
you're right .
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . you know she didn't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?
yeah . thanks for the talk .
i'll give you a call later . we should hang out . it's good to be around people .
ok . i'll talk to you later .
i think he's got too much on his plate .
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !
whoa , take it easy there rambo . don't get carried away . these weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . for example , never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself . always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !
wow , i didn't know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !
the reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?
let's do it !
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .
it wasn't always like this , you know .
what do you mean ?
well , i mean . we always do the same thing . there's no variety in our lives .
you need a holiday . that's what's the matter .
certainly , perhaps .
what a bummer ! you set me up ?
let me explain . i didn't mean to hurt you . . .
how dare you ! ( starts to walk off )
hang on one second . hear me out , just this once , isabella !
why did you lie to me in the email ?
i didn't lie . you just didn't ask me my real name .
i should have known it was you . no wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . i thought i might have found the one for me .
i'm sorry . it was cruel of me . but i promise it will never happen again ? look , there's a nice restaurant . let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
what do you drink ?
what was the score ?
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .
wonderful !
it's not as simple as that . people judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . so dressing professional is being professional . the image that you portray to others is so important in business . it's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .
maybe you're right , but i'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !
and your parents took it badly ?
that's putting it mildly . my father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .
ouch , that sounds bad . what did your sister do ?
she started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . my dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .
how long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
three years . they've been dating since freshman year . they're even talking about marriage .
really ? then i guess living together would be a good idea .
what do you mean ?
well , these days too many people are getting divorced . if they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .
i guess so . better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .
you're right . he sure is .
that's a good idea . let's go !
what a heavy snow ! look ! the water is frozen .
take care ! don't slip on the ground .
i've got it . i like the feeling of stepping on the ice .
yes . very wonderful .
there is a snowman over there .
how lovely it is !
why ?
you can get help there in dealing with the united states immigration and naturalization service ; you can find foreign student advisers .
what kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?
they'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .
can we get any more help at the international center ?
yes , a lot more . if you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student i d and social security number there . they will keep your documents up - to - date . they will offer an orientation program for new comers . they will also help you contact your department and registration office .
i see . it must be worth going to .
besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . in cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the international center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .
wonderful . it is a home for foreign students .
it sure is . they also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . the center staff members are also friendly and helpful . everyone loves them .
true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .
definitely . i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .
is that inflation ?
inflation is more than just the rising prices , i guess . but the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?
yes . the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .
but i'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .
you said it . i think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .
how ?
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . you know , running a car is a big expense .
sounds a good idea .
the touchdown lines are there and there . ok , let's play !
before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .
great ! it's just like viewless stores . but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?
that's simple . just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . and the goods will be delivered to your place .
is the service charged ?
no . it's free .
really . i'll get a computer at once .
thank you .
