surely , of course . what kind of currency have you got ?
rib .
how much would you like to change ?
that was quick ! i wasn't expecting it until later this week .
yes , our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system .
shall i come in and collect it ?
or we can send it to you . but if you would like to use it at the atm , you'll need to wait for your pin number .
mmmm ... if i come in and collect it this afternoon , is there any way i could use it today ? petty cash is getting low , so i need to draw some money .
as long as you bring your id , etc , we can serve you over the counter . but you won't be able to use the atm until your new pin number arrives .
how long does it take to reach taiwan by sea ?
usually about two month .
that's too long.how long does it take to reach taiwan by airmail ?
about ten days .
then how much is that by airmail ?
let me see.it ' s 57 dollars , 20 cents , including tax .
that's a little bit expensive .
although it's expensive to send it by airmail , it's quicker and safer than by sea .
i guess i have to send it by airmail .
do you want to ensure the contents , miss ?
yes , please .
please fill out this form , also please write the value of the items in this space .
yes , you are right .
is it far ?
no , it's only about five minutes ' walk .
thank you very much .
are you sure , sir ? flies i could believe , but cockroaches ?
i've counted nine different cockroaches , and i accidentally stepped on another one .
sir , we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel .
you dare to doubt me ?
oh ? that's a surprise . let me see ... d 0411 our dog's birthday . yes , i'm sure this my parking space !
but i saw a red car always parking here before .
oh , we've just repainted our car . it was red .
maybe . but the car of this space has a broken rearview mirror on the left .
yeah . it used to . we got that fixed yesterday too .
could you wait for a minute , sir ? i'd like to have a check .
sure , go ahead .
sorry , sir , my mistake . this is your parking space .
i like that kenmore refrigerator .
this particular refrigerator is a very good choice .
tell me about it .
not only is it affordable , but it comes with all the appliances .
what are the appliances .
it has an ice maker , water dispenser , and plenty of room on the inside .
i'd like to see it for myself .
go right ahead .
how much did that end up costing you ?
oh ... around twenty bucks . a bargain if you ask me . look at the picture of her playing with it !
hey , two for one . that's a super deal .
yeah , that sounds right .
there are about twenty people named chang who work here . what department ?
let me think ... accounting , finance , something like that .
eric chang in accounting ?
that's him !
i'll call him and tell him you're here .
i appreciate your help .
would you like to have a seat over there ? it'll just be a minute . and can i have your name ?
here's my card .
so , do you think our corporation will be eligible for this ?
yes . oh , dear , i can ’ t find my hairbrushes . can you help me ?
where have you put it ?
i put it in the dressing room .
are you sure ?
yes , quite sure .
then , have you looked downstairs ?
yes , i ’ ve looked everywhere downstairs .
look , dear . it ’ s over there .
where ?
but i didn't see the sign , ma ’ am .
there is a sign at the corner of the street . when you turned in here , you should have seen it .
i didn't see it .
i don't want to have a specific title . i just want to enjoy what i am doing .
that sounds very reasonable .
it's the most important thing to me .
if you are hired , how long do you plan to stay with us ?
that obviously depends on how things go - - whether i'm suited to the firm and the firm to me .
tell me about some of your recent goals and what you do to achieve them .
i want to put my knowledge and experience to use in a challenging position . in order to achieve this goal , i just want to work step by step .
what is your long-range objective ?
i haven't thought it over at all .
what do you think is the most important thing when looking for a job ?
oh , current accounts don't pay out interest .
why is that ?
it's primarily designed for business transactions . that is , writing checks to pay for bills , buying things and sending money . we won't expect a large amount of deposit in a current account .
it'll be a national campaign starting next week .
what style will the ads be ?
i suggest that we focus on slice of life , showing how you can beat the summer heat by biting into a cool ice-cream sandwich .
sounds like a good idea . will we have a new slogan ?
it's fish steamed and served with our special sauce .
is it good ?
sure . it's a most popular dish .
i think i'll try it , and give me some green salad together .
we have two dressings for salad . which one would you like ?
what kind do you have ?
we have french and thousand island .
ok , it's not far from here .
i have something important to do , can you fast the speed ?
sure , i'll try my best . here we are .
how much should i pay you ?
the reading on the meter is 15 yuan .
here's 20 yuan , keep the change .
so , what do we do now ?
this is the lease . you should read the lease very carefully before you sign it because it describes your legal rights and responsibilities as a tenant . the lease also describes our rights and responsibilities as landlords .
okay . ( reads the lease ) so , according to the lease , i ’ ll deposit one month ’ s rent as a security deposit , and i have to pay the first month ’ s rent in advance . i understand that i ’ ll get the security deposit back when i move out if the apartment does not need any costly repairs .
yes . if you do not damage the apartment , you will get your security deposit back when you move out .
can i pay you by check ?
sure . a check will be fine .
is there a laundry room in the basement ?
yes .
how much does a six-day tour by train cost ?
five hundred yuan .
does that include hotels and meals ?
oh , yes , and admission tickets for places of interest as well .
that sounds reasonable . what about the five-day flying journey ? how much is that ?
eight hundred and fifty yuan .
covering all expenses ?
we don't think so . casual days are becoming more common , and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes .
i guess it lets people express their individual tastes . but won't some people abuse it ?
not really . besides , there is a separate dress code for casual day . people can't just wear whatever they want .
it seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity .
no , not yet . first , i want to check about the availability and see if you could give more information .
it is urgent for us to fill this position now and i would like to stress that english is a must because of the international contacts and most likely traveling abroad very soon . if all these is not problem for you , i recommend you to mention these in your cover letter and send it to me directly .
no . i need a double and three triples . my family is waiting for me in the car .
please fill out this form , sir .
ok ... here you are .
here are your keys . check out time is noon .
is breakfast included ?
my stomach was bothering me .
are you feeling any better ?
i'm still feeling a little sick .
i'm going to the store , would you like any pesto pistol ?
all right . what shall i do now ?
just open your bags so we can check them . after that you can pick them up right behind that x-ray machine .
i've got film in my bag .
that's all right . this machine will not damage the film .
that's fine .
can i have your boarding pass ? we need to stamp it .
sure . here you are .
thank you .
am i through now ?
yes . here is your boarding pass .
yes.here they are . i ’ ve marked how many prints i want on each shot .
what size do you want the prints ?
four by six , except this one . i want a ten by thirteen print of this one .
how much does it cost ?
$ 600 .
does that include the insurance ?
yes , it's not too bad . our sales are going up year after year . and we still have a large potential production capacity .
well , what do you think of choosing a commission representative or agent abroad to promote your sales ?
that's a good idea . so far , we have several agents abroad .
we are willing to be your agent in thailand for hand-held tools . what do you think ?
that sounds good .
then , what's your usual commission rate for your agents ?
usually , we give a commission of 4 % to our agents .
4 % is too low , i think . you see , we have a lot of work to do in sales promotion , such as advertising on radio or tv , printing booklets , leaflets , catalogues and so on . it all costs money , 4 % is not enough .
don't worry . we'll allow you a higher commission rate if your sales score a substantial increase .
you mean to saya
it sounds ok . then how do you pay the commission ?
we may deduct the commission from the invoice value directly or remit it to you after payment .
all right . if it's okay , we would like to sign an agency agreement with you immediately .
think it over . we hope to keep a good business relationship with you .
i'm sorry . if you look at the ad again , you'll see that the other brand is on sale .
oh . you're right . i misread the ad .
yes , many people make that mistake .
well , you can't blame them . it's a confusing ad .
you're right . many ads are like that .
well , as long as i'm here .
no , i like being single . i never thought lonely , i'm focus on my career . maybe i'll start to look for my girl when i achieve success .
why is that ?
because i'm living a real world , a man enriched have a good career and make a lot of money . franklin speaking the girls i've met wounldn't married a man wounldn't make enough money .
well , the thing is , we ran into a lot of problems . . .
i ’ m not looking for excuses here . i just want to get this finished on time !
i know , and i apologize for the delay . but some things were just beyond my control . i had trouble booking the photographer , and then michael was sick for three weeks , so i couldn ’ t include him in the photos , and the design team lost all the files , so i had to re-do the pictures .
mr . j . smith .
where would you like him to come ?
to the front desk .
the best product is techne , and you can buy either the lotion or cream .
which one is best ?
the cream form is very popular .
can i do anything else to help with the itching ?
you could also take an antihistamine to help the rash go away quicker .
i appreciate you helping me find a solution to the itching .
oh , i am very sorry about that . it's our fault . i will arrange someone to correct it immediately .
ok , no problem . to err is human .
anyway , we apologize for the inconvenience we have brought you . please just wait for a moment , and it will be fixed .
booze !
this is very annoying .
i'm sorry , sir . do you wish to try something else ? that would be on the house , of course .
no , i don't risk it .
how about a delicious dessert then , with our compliment ?
i'm not keen on dessert as a habit . they are fattening .
is this your first time flying ?
yes . i'm going to san francisco .
oh , it's a beautiful city . i think you'll like it .
hey , i'm feeling much better already .
sometimes if you don't think about it , that sick feeling will go away on its own .
thanks . by the way , my name is mary .
no , that's ok . do you have any whole wheat bread ?
we are out at the moment . may i suggest some rye bread ?
sure that sounds good . do you have any cakes ?
we have various birthday cakes and also ice cream cakes .
i'll just take a cheesecake .
will that be all ?
yes .
i always drink too much wine in the evening .
you shan't drink more wine in the evening .
yes , you are right .
and you'd take some exercise every day .
what about rubella and mumps ?
well , i can only give him these for now , and after a couple of weeks i can administer the rest .
ok , great . doctor , i think i also may need a tetanus booster . last time i got it was maybe fifteen years ago !
what kind of teaching certificate do you have ?
i have a tefl certificate .
how many years of experience do you have ?
i have three years of teaching esl and four years of teaching per-school children .
when did you get your tefl certificate ?
i got my tefl certificate three years ago .
why do you want to teach at our school ?
well , i ’ ve heard many good things about it . i also like teaching young children .
that ’ s great . can you speak chinese ?
yes , just a little .
can you come in for an interview tomorrow at 10:00 ?
i sure can .
more and more people easily get irritated while driving .
to encourage the staff increases .
ok . next thing is laying the corner-stone for the new plant at 10 am . at 12 am , back here for lunch .
what about the afternoon ?
yes , i do . it's ready and waiting in my account .
the next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ...
could i just stop you there ? sorry to interrupt , but i have already been to your appointed dealer and selected the car i want .
that will certainly cut down the processing time . we can move on to the next step . do you have the purchase price ?
yes , it's 110,000 rib . so , with the down payment done , i will need to borrow 70,000 rib .
what we need you to do next is to come into the branch with a correctly filled in application form , id card , proof of residency , proof of income , the agreement from the agent and of course the 20 % down payment .
now let me show you around . this is our reception area , and our conference room is right over there . over here is the sales department .
really ? this is a nice office , but it's quite small .
yeah ... you can make photocopies and send faxes over there .
it looks like you guys work hard .
i tell you what just between you and me , we just mess things up so that it looks like we work hard.just kidding . oh , your cubicle is over the . and this way . those are all private offices the managers offices .
hmm ... tell me more details about our jobs .
i agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable .
i don't think so . you must compare our price with that of other export houses . i'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level .
i don't think we'll be able to pay the price . to have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % .
i ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price .
don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ?
we've already cut down our price to cost level .
is that all ?
yes , this is the best we can do .
i ’ ve never had a bank account before . why don ’ t i just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ?
you know you would spend it . and also , money in the bank earns interest .
but what if i need my money suddenly ?
the bank will give you a pin , and you can withdraw money from any atm .
great ! so it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters !
not quite . you have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . and sometimes the bank has service charges . but you don ’ t have to worry about that yet . let ’ s go make your first depot
you have to get off at the hospital and change for bus 15 .
our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard . on the 20th day of every month , you can get your salary on time . benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record .
wow , thank you for telling me these . do you mind telling me something else , like attendance record , holiday , and how to ask for leave ?
all new members are likely to ask the same questions . haha . i can understand that . every month you have three days off , besides the weekends and some important holidays . after you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . the leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .
you are kidding . what happened ?
well , i don't really know , but i heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce .
that's really surprising . i always thought they are well matched . what about the kids ? who get custody ?
masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out .
that's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . well , i still can't believe it , masha and hero , the perfect couple . when would they divorce be final ?
tim chen .
what's the number , please .
the area code is 2 , and the number is 2367-9960 .
of course i remember you .
i think i lost my wallet here .
oh , no . really ? i didn't see anything .
really ? you didn't find a wallet ?
no , i didn't . would you like to go look by the table with me ?
yes , i would . it's not here . and it's not on the floor.has anyone sat at this table since we left ?
no . it's been empty the whole time .
hmm . i don't know how it could have happened .
i remember , sir , that your friend took the bill.you didn't pay for the lunch yourself , did you ?
no . my friend did .
then are you sure you took your wallet out of your pocket while you were here ?
no , i'm not sure . but i usually take out my wallet when i sit down.it ' s uncomfortable to sit on it . so i usually put it next to me on the table .
maybe you lost it before you came here . or maybe you left it at home .
i don't think it's at home . i think i had it when i left the house.but what should i do ?
well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards . next , you need to replace whatever you lost , your driver's license , things like that .
should i call the police ?
you can if you want . but the police usually don't do anything about lost wallets .
hmm . i'll go home and check . maybe you're right . maybe it's at home .
i'm sorry we couldn't find it , sir .
it sounds like a special quilt . why do you want to sell it ?
well , this home is too big for me now , so i'm moving to an apartment that is much smaller . therefore , i need to part with a few things .
oh , i see . umm , how much do you want for the quilt ?
yes , of course .
is it all right for me to come in now , mr sun ?
well , uh ... i ’ m still pretty busy , but ... all right . come in . what can i do for you ?
do you mind if i sit down ?
not at all . take a seat . now what can i do for you ?
i want to leave the department . do you think i could put info a transfer ?
yes . but why should you want to do that ?
do you mind if i speak frankly ?
not at all . go ahead .
well . you see , i don ’ t like the office . i don ’ t like the staff . and i ’ m afraid of you . and i don ’ t want to go one . so may i put info a transfer ?
i have to be there before 17 o'clock .
we'll make it except a jam . you know it's rush hour .
there's an extra ten in it for you if you can get me there on time .
i'll do my best .
here's twenty dollars .
do you have small bills ?
no . if you can't break it , keep the change . but can you give me a receipt ?
come over here . i will test your eyes . first cover your left eye like this , and when i point , please read the chart from the top , and go as far as you can , telling me which way the “ e ” points .
all right .
good.now the other eye .
well , this one is worse .
never mind , just read as far as you can .
blackout ? even the tv has the limit .
don't you know you will look like a monster in the blackout ?
oops , no , daddy can't watch american idol , either !
that's not the point . come on , can you imagine that there will be no electricity on such a hot day ?
oh , my god ! no air-conditioner !
ok , since you are the smart one , can you come up with a better plan ? so that we won't be baked like cookies here .
how about playing barbie out there in the neighborhood ?
barbie ? you know , i might be seven , but i'm not a girl .
do you have a better plan ?
how much would it be ?
from 200 to 800 .
i'm afraid 800 is too expensive for me . could you recommend something around 300 ?
could you deliver it tomorrow ?
no problem .
please handle the items carefully .
certainly .
the position calls for a person with some working experience . we must be able to benefit from your analytical and interpersonal skills . can you deliver your resume to us first ?
of course . i will deliver my resume to you in minutes ' time . i hope you will consider my application and i shall appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience .
ok . i will call you soon . bye now .

i'm attending a conference in sydney this week . remember ?
oh , right . what time is it there ?
it's 10:00 p . m . and it's four o'clock in los angeles , right ?
yes - four o'clock in the morning .
4:00 a . m . ? i'm really sorry .
i think he will be back around 2:00 . if you like , please leave your name and phone number , i'll have him call you as soon as he comes back .
that's nice . my name is steven , my phone number is 6789777 . okay , i'll be waiting for his call . thank you and bye !
what's your flight number ?
flight ca216 to chengdu .
yes , it's true . it has been delayed .
could you please tell me why ?
yes , of course . the delay is due to heavy rain .
how long will the delay be ? do you have any further information about it ?
i am sorry , we don't know the extent of the delay at present . but according to the latest weather forecast , there will be a change in weather soon .
we have to wait . well , is it possible for the rain to stop before noon ?
it's hard to say . weather is so changeable in the summer . please listen to the latest announcement about your flight .
yes , i will . thanks a lot . bye !
i told you we should have stayed in town today.the weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.why did you want to come up here ?
i wanted to show you the cabin . we only had another half-hour to go .
well , now we're stuck . what can we do ?
i don't know .
i've heard that when this happens , it's important to save energy .
what do you mean ?
we're stranded here , tom . we may be here a long time.we need to conserve the gas in the car . the car's energy is what will keep us warm .
i have plenty of gas .
yes , but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.we can't just let the car run and run.if we do , it will die soon . then we'll freeze .
so what can we do ?
turn the lights off.then , run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.that will conserve the heat as long as possible .
alright . that's a good idea .
i wish we hadn't come up here . now we'll probably be here for days .
days ?
yes , it happens.that is what happens in big snowstorms . people get stranded for days .
oh , my god ! it's good we have food .
no , i ’ m afraid not .
well , you have to wait in line like everyone else . besides , you should let old people on first .
sorry .
it ’ s all right . where are you going ?
i wanted to see the white house .
oh , well you don ’ t want this bus , anyway . it goes to georgetown .
oh , no .
it ’ s all right , though . just get off at the next stop and catch the 79a .
oh , well thank you very much .
just coke will be fine .
would you like a super size meal ? only 2 rib more , you'll get large coke and fries instead of medium . and today we are offering free toys all the meal boxes .
that sounds good , thanks , i'd like that . actually i'd like sprite instead of coke , thanks .
that's not a problem , miss . will that be it ?
yes , that's all .
that will be 25rmb , please
yes , it is .
a pound of ground beef is $ 2.48 .
that's perfect .
what else will you be needing ?
i'm also going to need three pounds of chicken breasts .
the chicken breasts cost $ 4.05 per pound .
what's the total price for the chicken ?
it's going to be $ 12.15 .
do you sell direct to shops ?
yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . we have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen .
do you keep a stock of these things ?
in some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in london and act as distributors as well as agents . generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . we are paid for our service , of course .
that is , your commission .
yes , our commission is very reasonable . we usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal .
our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .
the european market is not familiar with your products . you have competitors from japan and other continental countries . at the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and tv programs . a 10 % commission will not leave us much .
according to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?
we will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with .
we appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . but our suggestion to you , mr . bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ...
do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
mr . bergeron , you leave us no alternative . we can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole european market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . besides our price is worked out according to the costing . a 10 % commission means an increase in our price . we must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect .
oh , that's just too bad . i intended to make great efforts in selling your products .
well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . to start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details .
ah , mrs . miller , but in this case am i covered ?
oh , yes . we will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction .
all right , but i'll be back again for the autumn fair . and then i hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency .
yes . all the quotations on the list are subject to our final confirmation .
i wonder whether there are any changes in your prices .
all these products are our best-selling lines . the prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . and we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . what do you have in mind ?
how long does your offer remain valid ? i need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan .
sounds good . i don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range .
we have this new etc smart phone.it comes with the android os so you can download applications . it also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . it works on the 3g network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are .
what about wi-fi ?
of course ! you can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home .
i will ! i ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard !
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?
we ’ re planning on having children soon , i don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .
fine ! let ’ s get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !
i ’ ll tell you what , i can get you some hamsters and we ’ ll take it from there .
i know what overbooked is , i just don ’ t understand how that could happen ?
actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats ,
so who has to stay behind ?
well , first we ask for volunteers . if someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . if no one volunteers we just have to select someone .
you will have to pay $ 1050 every month .
i can ’ t afford that .
what can you afford ?
i was thinking $ 800 a month .
i ’ ll need you to pay more than that .
how much more ?
how does $ 900 every month sound to you ?
i can live with that .
i ’ ve worked in the field for more than 4 years . depend on my work qualifications and experience , i would like to have 5000 yuan to start .
the basic salary for your position in our company would be 4800 yuan to start with increases giving according to your performance .
it is a bit lower than i expected . but i can accept that . what are the working hours ?
40 hours a week , monday to friday , 9 am to 5 pm with one hour lunch break every day ..
do i have to work on weekend ? if so , how do you pay for the overtime ?
we do expect overtime work when it is necessary , but we pay twice of the work hour for working on weekends and three times for working on national holidays like spring festival and the mid-autumn day .
is there probation ?
give me one coke , please .
is this to go or to eat here ?
to go , please .
that comes to four dollars and ten cents .
and can i have some ketchup , please ?
yeah ! i just started my training today and i ’ m not really sure where to begin .
it ’ s ok , i know how it is . this machine here will work out your upper body , mainly your triceps and biceps . are you looking to develop strength or muscle tone and definition ?
well , i don ’ t want to be ripped like you ! i just want a good physique with weights and carpio .
in that case you want to work with less weight . you can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets . five kilo weights should be enough . now it ’ s very important that you stretch before pumping iron or you might pull a muscle .
got it ! wow is that the weight you are lifting ? my goodness that ’ s a lot of weight !
oh , you're staying at the downtown hilton.then , you go down two blocks this way and turn left.you ' ll find it on the right .
it's about a ten-minute walk .
that's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
almost all of them do . a few are independent . that means that they do not belong to a party . if one party more than half of the mp ’ s . they form a government . that means that they choose a prime finist
what ’ s a cabinet ?
this is a small group of people-perhaps 25 mp ’ s who are usually ministers . they make all the big decision and discuss laws and policy .
can any mp make a law ?
any mp can present a law to parliament . the proposed law is debated and voted on . if it is accepted , it becomes law .
i suppose a proposed a law needs the support of the big political parties .
yes , it does , because they have most of the mp ’ s . most mp ’ s vote the way their party wants them to .
how do people choose which party or candidate to vote for ?
i told him that i hadn ’ t got a raise for three years . i also told him that one of my best co-workers quitted her job because she had not been promoted for eight years .
did he want to know the reasons ?
yes . i told him that my boss made some excuses of the recession . but i thought he had a pattern and a record of promoting men only .
that ’ s sex discrimination . when will you get the reply ?
in a couple of days , i was told .
wish you good luck !
i understand . now , you're saying that you've already used up all your amenities ?
oh , no ! i've got all i need for my stay here .
so , what's the problem ?
i need souvenirs !
you want some souvenirs !
yes , yes . souvenirs .
but , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
that's not the same thing . if you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
a nice quiet house is exactly what we're looking for .
well , gentleman.each room is $ 40 a week if you think that's ok .
that sounds just wonderful to us .
when do you want to move in ?
how about this afternoon ?
no , i want the fish .
our special tonight is lobster .
thank you , but i prefer the fish .
perhaps you'd enjoy the lamb .
no , i like the fish .
want to taste this dish ?
yeah . oh , it's delicious !
really ?
definitely . it's a wonderful meal . thank you , honey .
if you like to help me do the dishes , i'll be more dreadful .
of course . first you should do up your long hair and do make up but not too thick .
is there anything else i should pay attention to ?
yes , when you attend the interview , you should pay attention to your manner , style of conversation and expression . you should keep smiling always , being polite when you talk with the interviewer . don't move from time to time when you sit there . and you also should know how to use eye contact .
thank you , i've learned so much from you .
oh , yeah . well , uh , about your mug ...
sure . here you are .
just a moment , please . i'll draw up your bill for you ... thank you for waiting , sir . your bill totals two thousand six hundred and fifty-eight yuan , including the phone and laundry .
that much ! would you mind letting me have a look at it ?
not at all , sir . here you are .
thanks . well , it seems to be right . how much is that in dollars , please ?
just a moment , sir . i'll calculate that for you . it comes to 305 dollars and 52 cents at today's exchange rate .
i see . ok .
how would you like to make the payment ?
in cash , please . here you are .
thank you , sir ... here is your change . could you check it , please ? thank you for choosing our hotel . i hope you enjoyed your stay .
by the way , please forward my mail to this address .
it's more than special . you can find as many kinds of animals as you can put a name to and more .
oh , really ? are there any snakes ?
snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .
that's terrific . i can't wait to check it out .
hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non-traditional pet ?
why not ? it's so cool .
but it will pose a risk to your health .
pardon ?
i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria . they are likely to cause immune system problems .
well , i didn't realize that .
i don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .
oh , i should have thought of my brother's baby girl . maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .
yes , i ’ m . are you french , too ?
no , i ’ m not .
what nationality are you ?
i ’ m italian . are you a teacher ?
no , i ’ m not .
what ’ s your job ?
i ’ m a keyboard operator . what ’ s your job ?
did you vote for him , because i know that i did .
i did , too .
i have nothing but faith in obama .
really ?
i ’ m sure he will help better america .
we do need some change in this country .
our country is already changing as it is .
you ’ re absolutely right .
no , thanks , i ’ ll come back later . may i reserve a table for two ?
yes , of course . may i have your name , sir ?
bruce by the way , can we have a table by the window ?
we ’ ll try to arrange it , but i can ’ t guarantee sir .
that ’ s fine .
yes , sometimes the music there is so beautiful . it is very romantic . i can stay there for hours .
do you often go there alone ?
that is the ford focus . a very light but powerful vehicle . it comes with dual side airbags , power steering and power windows , tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission .
sounds like a good car ! how many miles to the gallon ?
it is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about 34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway .
that is really convenient . especially now that fuel prices are so high ! what ’ s under the hood ?
a very powerful 2.5- liter turbocharged engine , trust me , this car is fast !
now for the most difficult question . what is the price tag for this lovely vehicle ?
very affordable mam . you can take it out of this lot today with 0 % down payment and no interest for the first year ! you can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back .
eight dolls fifty a week excluding laundry .
would it be convenient to see the room ?
no , no . nothing at all like that . it's just that i applied for a credit card with you a while ago , my application was accepted , but i'm still waiting for my card .
oh , i see , sir . well , it does take 5 working days to issue and post the card .
yes , my application was accepted last friday . now it's wednesday , that's more than 5 days .
sorry , sir , but it's 5 working days . this does not include weekends , so your card should be with you later this week .
of course ! how silly of me ! yes , 5 working days would mean this friday , at the earliest . i see . i'm sorry to trouble you .
it's no trouble at all , sir . is there anything else i can help you with today ?
orange juice , scrambled eggs , bacon , toast and coffee .
ok , and when shall i bring it here ?
about seven thirty.by the way , could you also bring me tomorrow's papers ?
yes . they usually do it .
do they charge for that ?
of course . in europe , they charge a commission of 1 % of the amount of the claim for their service .
is it the same in america ?
they do the work without charge to the importer .
it's part of their service , isn't it ?
exactly .
is it enough to claim with an on board bill of lading ?
no , you must also obtain a statement from the shipping agent certifying that the goods were actually loaded on their vessel for shipment .
i see . by the way , how do we prove the ownership of our goods ?
you must provide full original set of ocean bills of lading original insurance policy or certificate and the original commercia invoice .
i see . thank you .
all right . shall i enter all my belongings ?
no ! five minutes i promise !
come on ! we have been here for almost an hour ! i thought you said you were only going to get a few things ! how long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish !
are you crazy ? you have no idea what you are talking about ! just for my eyes i have to get eye-liner , an eyelash curler , eye shadow , an eyebrow pencil and mascara . then i need to get foundation , liquid foundation .
whoa whoa whoa ! are you nuts ? how much is all this going to cost ? i ’ m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ’ s outrageous ! this is basically a crayon !
what about you ? you spend as much or more money on your razors , after shave , cologne and gel ! not to mention how much you spend on clothes and ...
last time i lent you money , you never paid me back .
i promise if you lend me five dollars today , i will repay you in full next week .
ok , but i'm taking your skateboard as collateral .
fine ! i can't believe you don't trust me .
not really .
how about this one ?
i like the design , but don't particularly care for the colour . do you have that in other colours , too ?
well , they come in white , pale yellow , aqua , red and green . will a white one do ?
yes . i prefer white - and may i see a pale yellow one , too ?
i do yoga twice a weeks
yoga ? it sounds interesting .
it was hard at the beginning , but now feel it's really relaxing . it makes me flexible .
anything else ?
yes , i often go swimming .

no , i'm not . i'm going to look for an apartment .

to be frank , you are not the only one who applies for an agent for us in your country . i'd like to know some ideas of terms on which you would be willing to operate as our agent .
as we are a well-established company , we are very familiar with the customers ' needs . besides , we can make full use of our good connections with the wholesalers and retailers here and develop a good market for your products if appointed as your agent .
sounds reasonable . i will tell my boss about you agent application . another question , what do you think is the minimum annual sales you can guarantee ?
to be on the safe side , and for garment of all materials , sizes , and styles , i think the amount will be 50,000 pieces a year .
well . as our sole agency , you will neither handle the same or similar products of other origins nor re-export our goods to any other area outside your own .
yeah , exactly ! i bought them last year . en ... at present , they are still in good state .
that's it ! all of them have first-class quality and performance . besides , we adopt advanced technology . now we have developed new products . they are much better than what you have bought .

how would you like your bills ?
not really . there aren't any used bookcases listed . but there are a few rummage sales on saturday . i think i'll go to them .
do you mind if i go with you ?
not at all . these private sales are great places to bargain . and sometimes you can find terrific things among all the junk .
i learned to negotiate from my mother . i thought i was pretty good at bargaining , but i had a problem the other day at kimble's department store .
what happened ?
not really . i know that it happens , but if you buy from reputable companies with secure websites , you should be ok . even though i use online shopping facilities , i don ’ t think it ’ s the best way to sho
i ’ m surprised to hear you say that . i thought you loved anything technological .
i do . i ’ m a big fan of using new technology , but i don ’ t want to sit in front of a computer screen all day . i think people need to get out and interact with other people .
so , how about coming to the department store with me ? i want to see if there are any new summer clothes on sale yet .
sure . i ’ d love to join you . can we stop by the computer store ? i just want to see if they have something .

i'm just going to let you go , since the arresting officer isn't here .

i was wondering if the chef could leave off the sauce .
the chef would be happy to accommodate your special requests .

i need an appointment on tuesday .
fine , i am putting you down for 9
i would like to see dr . jones .
actually , you might because there ’ s a big convention in town this weekend .
well , actually , it's quite a substantial amount . here's my bank book . will that cause a problem ?
on your account there is no limit to over the counter withdrawals , it won't cause a problem . here's your money , 10,000 rib . please count it before you leave .
i often eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?

well , i walk every day .
it's a good diet and a regular exercise .
what doesn ’ t feel right ?
i feel as if i am going to be sick to my stomach .
perhaps you should get checked out at the student health center before you go home .
i have some medicine at home that i could take .
are you going to be ok to drive home , or would you like someone to go with you ?
thank you , but my friend is in the library , and he can give me a ride home .
this is already our best price .
but the price is always negotiable and you should consider our quantity of order .
well , what would you suggest ?
could you make it $ 4500 ?
i'm afraid that there is no room to negotiate the price . this is the best price we can quote .
can we meet each other half way ?
what do you mean ?
let's close the deal at $ 4800 , ok ?
what kind of watch is it ?
it's a brand-new seiko wrist watch .
yes , we have it .
i think that the apartment looks very nice , but i do see some problems .
what problems ?
i did notice a few stains in the carpet .
we will have the carpet cleaned before you move in .
you will ?
yes , but other than that , are there any more problems ?
that was the only thing that i saw that was wrong with the apartment .
i ’ m happy that you find this apartment so appealing .
please do , the fitting-room is over there .
it feels a little tight around the waist . do you have a bigger one ?
i'm sorry . we don't have this color in your size . we have some green ones in your size . would you please have a look at this green one ?
ok . how much does it cost ?
so do we . certainly it's a step forward on your side . but the gap is still too wide .
the ball is in your court , mrs.wang . what price would you suggest ?
to make your offer workable , i think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .
that won't do . you see , our profit margin is very narrow . it simply can't stand such a big cut .
i hate to disappoint you , mr . brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . do think it over , please . we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion .
well , i'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . would you mind waiting a day or two , until i get a reply from the home office ?
not at all . shall we meet again , say , on friday morning ?
thank you.but i will call her later
ok.goodbye .
yes , my watch says a quarter to seven . but there is something wrong with my watch !
but you bought it only last month .
yes , but ever since i bought it , it gains about five minutes a day , so i ' ve got to have it repaired .
how long will it take us to get there ?
i think about ten minutes by bus .
it's not far away , then . let's walk , it's beginning to rain .
i know . i figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ?
well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . so try to come at least once a year for your own good .
ok .
let me see here . your eyes and ears look fine . take a deep breath , please . do you smoke , mr . smith ?
yes .
smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease , you know . you really should quit .
i've tried hundreds of times , but i just can't seem to kick the habit .
well , we have classes and some medications that might help . i'll give you more information before you leave .
sure , please hold on .
thank you .
now mr . tylor's on the line . go ahead , please .
you are so kind , you helped me a lot .
i'm afraid so , yes .
hmm ... well , it was my first attempt ! is it a very big mistake , or can we just alter it ?
unfortunately it's rather a big mistake .
what do you recommend we do ?
i would recommend we scrap this one and you bring in another set as soon as possible .
well , suffer then . if you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
it always hurts . i hate going .
stop being such a baby . if it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
o . k . , o . k . , i ’ ll go .
about twelve hours . we currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . if you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive .
yeah , i think that is the best option . do you serve food on the train ? twelve hours is such a long time !
yes , of course . there is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . we do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers .
great ! i ’ ll take it .
here you are sir . your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !
i understand . thank you very much !
so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
it sounds like it will be .
i really hope it doesn't get cold .
that would ruin things , i want to go so badly .
the weather in california is unpredictable , so you never know .
that is true . the weather is constantly changing .
it would be nice if the weather would never change .
that would be great , then we could plan things sooner .
but if two employees are in love , they will be happy . happy people are more productive . if they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . it can help to improve work efficiency .
what's special about these things ?
cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-i think it's also tastier than normal rice . yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . people have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled .
is that so ?
yes , i don't want to be stuck in a rut . i want to move on .
have you decided ?
yes . i want to get a better job .
could you tell me why you want to quit ?
i quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
oh , that's terrible . do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?
i'm afraid not . i've promised my girlfriend . we'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
ok , i'd like to say that i've really enjoyed working with you . however , i think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay .
thank you so much for your advice .
and every best wish for your new job .
seats no . 20 and 21 . it ’ s nice that we ’ ve got a window seat .
let's put our suitcases on the rack .
oh , the baggage rack is full . put them under the seat for the time being .
it's not that bad . you probably just had a bad experience once .
it wasn't just once . every single time i take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus .
we could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice .
train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too .
if we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . should we take the bus ?
we're already late , so i think we had better take a taxi .
i don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . let's just take the bus .
fine . have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . nothing bad will happen . i'll even buy your ticket for you .
thanks , that was nice of you .
relatively , once we're out of alberta , anyway . then it's hills again in aitoba .
and from winnipeg we go around the lakes through toronto , right ?
that's right . and up in to quebec . and that's where we stop .
it doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride .
anyhow , i'd like to change our room .
no problem , sir . we'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . could you wait till tomorrow ? the american people-to-people education delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . there'll be some rooms for you to choose from .
all right . i hope we'll be able to enjoy our stay in a quiet suite tomorrow evening and have a sound sleep .
i'm not going to be able to fall asleep .
why don't you try counting sheep ?
i've tried that before . it really doesn't work .
that's beside the point , you still need to go to bed .
why can't i just stay up until i fall asleep ?
if i let you do that , then you're just going to be up all night .
i promise i'll go to sleep soon .
no , you're going to sleep now , so good night .
how would you deal with those who are not easy to get along with ?
i will just be sincere and friendly to others , and i believe they will treat me the same way .
you seem to be a kind-hearted lady .
thank you . i simply believe the goodness of human nature .
please tell me your weaknesses if you can .
we have a very wide selection of colors . and our eye shadow is specially designed to moisturize the skin . so it is very gentle on your eyelids . would you like to sample some ?
oh , sure i will need to clean off my own eye shadow first .
i can help you with that .
so you have to bring your baggage to the transfer check-in area .
yes.it ' s quite troublesome .
i don ’ t know . it was there when i woke up this morning .
it ’ s rash . i ’ d better take you to see the doctor . how did you get that bruise on your leg ?
i bashed it against the chair in my room .
does it hurt ?
a little , but not much .
here . put this wet towel on your face to keep your temperature down . i ’ ll take you to the doctor ’ s after breakfast .
if i ’ m better this afternoon , can i go to school ?
sure , that sounds great . where are your appetizers listed ?
there is a special appetizer menu right here in the center of the table .
the chicken and cheese quesadilla looks good . is that pretty good ?
you know , that is one of my favorites !
ok , i'll take one order of that .
you could choose another appetizer for half price to share .
is that right ?
i am a volunteer for this year ’ s campaign .
that ’ s wonderful . i am impressed at someone so young taking a stand .
i know history is about to be made , and i would like to be a part of it .
that ’ s fantastic .
are you planning on voting ?
i ’ m going to vote .
go to your polling place early on election day .
at first i didn't know anything about the machine . now i know how to operate it . besides , the work gives me a sense of fulfillment and achievement .
yeah , you are a good learner . i must commend you for your good performance .
thank you . that's a long way to go for my job .
i appreciate your effort very much . the coffee break is over ; it's about time we set to work .
i'm not sure , but i think you turned right when you should have turned left on the flyover bridge .
well , now we should turn back a few kilometres .
is it possible to change to another room ?
could you please tell me why ?
my room is facing the swimming pool . it ’ s noisy for me . i have a problem sleeping . and i feel uncomfortable when i take an elevator .
so you need a quiet side room on the lower floor .
you ’ re right .
okay . let me check for a room on the first floor .
thank you .
i ’ ve only two rooms on the first floor . how about room 108 ?
that ’ s fine . can i move now ?
sure . i ’ ll send the bellman to help you .
oh , thank you kindly .
you may ask questions about us , if you have any .
yes , the officer is here today .
what's your case ?
i was pulled over for running a red light , but i never did .
do you believe that the officer lied ?
there was a camera on the signal . so , he was obviously lying .
your license plate was caught on camera ?
a picture of my license plate was never taken .
since there is no picture of your license plate on record , i'm going to let you go .
that's my problem . i don't have a lot of options .
what do you mean ? this is a big store , isn't it ?
yes , but i have unusually big feet . that wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that i can fit into .
so how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ?
well , first of all , i can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection .
well , you're in the right store . if they don't have it , no one will .
me , too . what did you have in mind ?
i haven't decided yet , but i think the olympic mascots are a must .
i agree . they're very lovely , especially " huan huan " .
is that the red one ? that is my favorite , too . do you know how much they are ?
the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . the bigger they are the more expensive .
oh , i see . if i buy more than a set , can i get any discount ?
i don't think so . all the souvenirs of the olympic games are very hot right now .
any other ideas ?
there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts .
no dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables .
but i don ’ t like them ! it ’ s not fair !
you can have some fruit for dessert . if you eat an apple and a banana , i might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake .
ok ... actually , i don ’ t mind eating peas and carrots , buy i hate broccoli and cauliflower .
i ’ ll remember that for next time . you ’ ll get extra peas and carrots , buy no broccoli or cauliflower . ok ?
that ’ s our latest development . a product with high performance . we put it on the market just two months ago .
the machine gives you an edge over your competitors , i guess .
certainly . no one can match us as far as speed is concerned .
could you give me some brochures for that machine ? and the price if possible .
right . here is our sales catalog and literature .
well , the parts are automatically selected from the store room using a bar-code system . and there is an automatic feeder which takes them to the conveyor belt at the start of the production line .
what about the smaller components ?
i guess . don't you have reunions in taiwan ?
definitely . every year . but just for our forty-person class .
no , i can only carry on a simple conversation in french .
can you read and write english well ?
i can speak the language better than read and write .
do you speak the language well enough to communicate with people of english-speaking countries ?
i think so . i used to be an interpreter .
do you think your english is good enough to do desk work ?
is there something go with the filet steak ?
i don ’ t have onions on my list . i ’ ll add them . we should get some tea . is green tea ok or should we get the same tea that we usually get ?
let ’ s get both . we need some coffee too . is that on your list ?
yes , it is . here ’ s my list . is there anything that i ’ ve forgotten ?
i think you ’ ve got everything . i want to got some chocolate and some cheese .
what kind of cheese do you want .
i ’ m not sure . i ’ ll decide at the cheese counter , when i can see what they have . have we got enough money ?
we don ’ t have enough cash , so i ’ ll take my credit card and we can pay with that . where are the car keys ?
i don't think i have any problem with our chinese partners . they have always followed the contract strictly . we can do business directly with the corporation . as i mentioned before , the chinese government is trying very hard to perfect its law . its commercial legislation provides legal protection for foreign companies .
well , it's known that the sino-american relation is in a dilemma . does it influence your business in china ?
actually not at present . but we are afraid it will . you know policies influence business to some extent . i hope our government will not be influenced by some extremists . china is really a large market . we don't want to lose it .
thank you .
just a moment , i'll look up the rate for air-mail letters to south america .
can you tell me how much it will cost to send a package to colombia ? also , i what to know how long it will take .
do you have the package with you ? i would have to weigh it to see how much it would cost .
do you insure package ?
yes . all you have to do declare the value of the package and decide how much you want to insure it for .
is there a way that i can be sure that the people in south america receive my package ?
the post office rarely loses package . you can , however , request a rectum receipt .
one last question-what are your hours ?
we open at eight-thirty in the morning and close at five-thirty in the afternoon .
why are you switching jobs at this point in your career ?
our company is moving overseas and i wish to stay in the united states .
what are you best at ?
i am good at organizing systems that have been having problems .
what is your biggest challenge in terms of skills ?
i don ’ t like to sit around and so like to always find things to do to keep myself busy .
this is tim . hunter from hunter industries .
and what is it regarding please ?
we have an appointment for this afternoon . mr . chen will know why i'm calling .
yes , it does seem a little silly to cash it now . i'll probably need about 25,000 rib . will that be a problem ?
not at all , mr zu . as the certificate is due in 2 months , you can get the loan on mortgage of that certificate .
i'm glad you thought of this . i'd have just gone ahead and cashed it ! and i suppose i can use the money from the certificate to pay back this personal durable commodities loan and i won't lose any interest , right ?
exactly right . if you'd like to go ahead , i can process that for you now , mr zu .
i have to say , i have had enough of this roller coaster .
i know what you mean . i'm like a yo-yo .
lobster ? it is steamed and served with our special sauce .
is it good ?
sure . it is a most popular dish .
i ’ m afraid i must . look at it ! it ’ s terribly dry .
what a nuisance !
last summer it was very dry , too . don ’ t you remember ? i had to water it every day .
well , i ’ ll have tea by myself . that was quick ! have you finished already ?
yes , look out of the window .
it ’ s raining . that means you needn ’ t water the garden .
that was smart .
anyway , do you have any change i can use for the bus ?
i don't have any .
i don't know how i'm going to get home .
get a transfer from the bus driver .
how much is a transfer ?
it doesn't cost anything .
that's great ! thanks for your help .
i've got a backache .
do you often suffer from backache ?
no , i don't . i've never had a bad one before .
when did it start ?
about four days ago .
well , go home and rest in bed for two days , then you'll feel better .
can you give me some medicine ? it's very painful .
thank you . where can i put my suitcase ?
either in the overhead compartment or underneath the seat .
what ? what's wrong ?
i'm sorry but 5 of these notes seem to be counterfeit . look at this watermark , do you see it ?
no , no , no . i'm just browsing . thanks anyway .
well , if you need anything , just ask .
um ... well , where's the men's shoe department ?
it's on the third floor . turn left when you get off the escalator .
i didn't know . i'll go to get it . how late will you be open ?
are you serious ?
yes , i am really excited .
that's great . congratulations .
i appreciate that .
you have no idea how happy i am for you .
for real ?
that's good . we eat chinese food only at the chinese restaurant .
my mother can make some chinese food .
oh , breaktime flies .
come on , baby . it ’ s time now .
mam , another minute , could i ?
no , this is the second time .
that's right . it's normal if you don't often take the plane . just relax a little bit .
why this happens to me when i am on the plane ? i feel bad .
don't worry , sir . it's just because of the lower pressure .
what should i do about it ?
you may feel much better if you chew some gum or peanuts .
ok , thanks . does it work really ? i'll give a try .
are you feeling better now ? do you need some pills ?
much better . thank you . i just feel tired but i can't fall asleep .
so , you'd better wear this eyeshade and you will sleep well .
i am not used to wearing that . thanks .
if you try to adapt yourself to your destination's local time , you'll feel more comfortable . so please try to sleep , and have meals according to los angeles's time .
which room are you in ?
1808 . the toilet doesn ’ t work properly ; the water doesn ’ t run in the shower .
well , ou can't hear music until takeoff .
i ’ m afraid not . it has to be a passport or a valid driver ’ s license .
oh ... wait a minute ... here ’ s my driver ’ s license .
ok , just fill in this application . you can sit over there . this brochure explains our services . we have free checking , and you will be given a debit card and on atm card . there is no service
what happens now ?
well , my car won't start . i don't know what's the matter with it .
could it be the battery ?
no , i don't think it could be . i checked the battery two days ago.it must be other problems .
well , i suppose it could be the gas .
no , there is plenty of gas . i filled it up yesterday .
perhaps it's the starter then ?
it's meanly about relationship between a brother and a sister , who live in the mill on the river floss . it describe there are childhood and disputes cause them to separate , the book ends with them ha

and what about your customer service ?
we provide free delivery and installation .

it is two-year and covers parts and service .
it's okay . it's probably my husband's fault.is there a pool in this hotel ?
yes , of course.the pool is open until 10:00 p . m . so you still have about 45 minutes .
good .
here is your key . your room is 379.you can find the elevators just around that corner there , down the hall.enjoy your stay , ma'am .
the bus is cheaper but also slower . it will take about two-and-a-half hours .
and how long does the train take ?
if you take the fast train , it will take about 50 minutes .
where do i catch the train ?
the trains for cambridge leave from king's cross station . they run approximately every half hour . most trains to cambridge go from platform 9 .
how do i get to king's cross ?
the best way is to take an underground tube train directly to king's cross . the underground station is just round the corner from here .
can you show me on the map ?
it is very easy . just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads . the entrance to the underground station is about 50 meters further on .
thank you very much .
here's information about our competitor's recent market activities ...
thanks , this will be a big help in putting together next quarter's marketing strategies . with competition this intense , we'll have to step up production even more . we need a price we can compete with .
we're in a very competitive environment . it's sink or saimin this market .
i want a single room with ocean view . do you have one ?
let me check . yes .
ok . i will take it .
when do you check in ? how long are you planning to stay ? do you have any special requirements ?
i guess i am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and i would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on sunday . please give me a room away from the elevator . i hate noises while i am sleeping .
i don ’ t think he ’ s back today .
oh , that ’ s right . go ahead anyways . i ’ ll fill him in . we can ’ t lose this order under any circumstances !
it's hard for us to believe it . our instruments have been the best quality for years . have you any reliable evidence ?
here is the survey report from a well-known public surveyor in london . you may inspect the defective instruments personally
well . according to the contract , we are responsible for repairing or replacing those defective instruments . we ’ ll send our technicians to repair them .
forty faulty instruments means that 4 % are not up to the standard . you should compensate us for 4 % of the total account on the contract , as well as for the inspection fee .
i am sorry about the quality problem , but i propose we compensate you for 3 % of the total value apart from the inspection fee .
grannie always tries to stay fit and healthy . she is always making us kids eat the proper foods .
well , it pays off for her . how old is she anyway ?
she will be 86 next month .
well , girls like us are happy to spend our time on those kinds of things . actually , do we still have a meeting this afternoon ?
oh , you stay at the down town hilton . when you go down two blocks this way and turn left , you will find it on your right .
yes , they are . i gave them a good clean . they are in good condition and don ’ t need to be replaced .
how long did it take you to do the tiling .
as i hadn ’ t done it before , i had to keep referring to income 3ation i got from the internet . doing the floor tiles took a whole day-from early morning to right through to the evening . then i spent a few hours replacing the cracked wall tiles . putting the cupboard up took about an hour , so it took me two days altogether .
i think you ’ ve done a very good job . as least as good as a professional would do . perhaps i can convince you to redo my bathroom ?
oh , this one ... here .
may i try it ?
sure .
it's very smooth . i'll take it .
cash or charge ?
i ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . you know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . the price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
i ’ m afraid i can ’ t agree with you there . i must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ ve received from other sources .
but you must take the quality into consideration . everyone in the trade knows that us ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
i agree that yours are of better quality . but there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . you can ’ t very well ignore that . prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years .
there ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . that ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . to be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price .
why do you want to go to the us ?
i'd like to have further education.now i am studying for my doctorate .
will you get any kind of scholarship ?
it is 3.2 % . you may earn a little interest on money .
is there any minimum deposit for the first time ?
yes , the opening minimum deposit is 1,000 yuan .
what about the later deposits ?
for the later deposits , you can deposit any you want . even one yuan is ok .
ok , that's good .
your id , please .
here you are , a thousand yuan and my id .
wait a moment , please ... here is your bankbook . keep it well please .
i have ten years marketing experience . this includes both entry level and management positions . in my last position , i worked my way up to being director of the marking department .
i can see that from your resume.your last position was marketing director for a pharmaceutical company , is that right ? later , why did you decide to leave your former post ?
i felt after five years in one place , i was ready for something new . i would like to have a job that is challenging , something that i can see and do new things every day . i loved many things about my former job , and i left with amiable feelings on both sides . i was just ready for something new .
i see . do you want to work full-time or part-time ?
i would rather work full-time .
i'll make note of that . now , what are your salary expectations ?
well . i guess i can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or apartment available .
thank you . i think i should also have a look at the internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .
how much do are you looking to spend ?
i can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month .
looks like you'll have to get a place in the suburbs .
it doesn't matter , but it needs to be close to the subway or on a convenient bus route .
anything you need to have in the place ?
i want a bedroom with full bath , and it'll be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side .
you can also check out university bulletin boards .
why ? will those be students who are leaving ?
not really , but landlords put up notices to attract students and they often have low rent .
thank you . i'll be sure to take a look .
your honor , the police officer pulled me over for speeding .
you must've been speeding .
no , your honor , i was not .
tell me how many miles per hour you were going .
i was going 35 in a 40 mph zone .
that's fine , so i'll let you go with a warning .
so , i don't have to pay the ticket ?
you won't have to pay the fine .
like snacking ?
you know , a little piece of chocolate here , some chips on the side , candy now and then ...
i get what you mean .
instead , i sit down and have a good snack like a piece of fruit between meals .
we can provide you with standby letter of credit established by bank of china .
should we pay earnest money ?
yes , you are supposed to pay it on time . if you don't furnish a tender bond on time , your tender will not be considered . besides , you also should provide derailed engineering of the good .
where do we submit the tender ?
to our office which is on the third floor .
oh , i see . by the way , is tender-opening done publicly ?
yes . all the bidders will be invited to join us to supervise the tender-opening .
and are the prices stated in the us dollar ?
yes , so far as we know , in the field , your company has lots of experience and we hope you will consider the tender seriously .
ok ! we will . bye !
really ?
yes . the beer is brewed by using carefully selected malts , rice , hops and natural water from the lao mountain .
how about its taste ?
fine , sir .
that sounds great . two tsingtao beers , please .
tin or bottle ?
tin , please .
would you like it on the rocks , sir ?
no , thank you .
that is good . and here i give you a piece of advice . you should have used stronger cardboard boxes for such a heavy item . besides , it's better to secure the cartons with metal straps . what's more , the order number wasn't anywhere on some of the boxes .
i realize that now . i will do that after a while .
thank you . can i open the packages to check the color and style ?
of course , let me help you .
the color and style are consistent with the sample . great !
you know , we are superior to other clothes companies .
yes , that's for sure . there is nothing wrong with the quality . i think you'd better pack them first in plastic bags , than in cartons .
no .
daddy , you always arrange your schedule so tight on weekdays . you should have a rest on weekends .
what park do you want to go to ?
daniel wants to go to the aquarium . while mom wants to visit the summer palace .
haven't we been these places already ?
yeah . i don't agree with them , but i don't have a better choice .
what about the olympic park ?
right , ah . it is so close to our home . how come we've never thought of that ?
the olympic park has a small forest . it is fit for picnic .
there are several , take a piece . the crash appears in the headline . it is famous for offering catastrophe stories .
i have a long flight for ten hours . i need to choose a magazine .
there are various magazines in the rack .
give me the latest issue of ' national geographic ' .
that's the top magazine in america and is popular with young people . ok . it is totally 30 dollars .
here you are .
that sounds simple enough . do you charge any admin fees for that ?
you'll have to pay 20 rib , and then you will have your southern fund management company card .
do you need any other documentation from me ?
no ! he hit me first .
describe her to me .
she's not too tall .
well , how tall is she ?
she's about 5 feet even .
what does she look like , though ?
she has pretty light brown eyes .
i may know which girl you're talking about .
so you have seen her around ?
i think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
well , may i leave a message ?
yes , of course .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
ok . does he know your number ?
i'm afraid he doesn't . my mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
it's a fruit . it has a big stone in it .
can you eat the stone ?
no . you would break all your teeth on it .
how much are these mangoes ?
the sale price today is $ 1 each .
can you describe their taste ?
they usually taste sweet , but they remind me of an orange .
how can i tell if they're ripe ?
don't cut into them until you can feel that they're soft on the outside .
what country produces them ?
no , i haven ’ t had any professional experience , but i have always been interested in creative writing .
have you ever had a foreign instructor in english composition ?
yes , my college teacher was an australian . she was also our adviser on our english language newspaper . i was the editor for two years .
that ’ s very interesting . tell me what you did exactly .
well , i planned the layout of the newspaper and then i assigned various articles and columns to other students to write . i wrote the editorial each time .
what is your aim in going into the field of journalism ?
to be frank with you , i would like nothing better than to be an overseas reporter some day .
that can be a rough job , you know .
yes , i know that . but i like adventure and excitement in my writing .
well , working in an editorial office may not be exciting enough for you . what do you think ?
i would be glad to do routine work sometimes , if i could be assured of making advancements in the future .
i think this type of position would be a very good start for you . i am quite sure we can work something out for you , but i cannot give you a definite answer today . we will let you know within just a few days .
i need to talk with marry .
certainly , hold on .
oh , sweet . you've always been my love too .
i don't think i say this enough , but i want to thank you for your kind listen patience , you ' ve always been there for me .
i'll do everything for you , love . you know that , maybe you didn't realize , but you made everyday a enjoys moment and happy occasion .
why do people like all this fancy , expensive underwear ?
what kind of question is that ?
i'm just curious . i think women are beautiful without this stuff .
thank you .
shall i get you some water ?
i see . maybe i can offer you a credit note .
well . to be honest , that's not much use to me . i'll leave the country tomorrow . i'd really prefer a refund .
well , it's just that i think if you don't enjoy doing something any more , you should stop doing it .
i see.you mean you don't enjoy smoking any more ?
that's right . you should give it up , too.it ' s bad for your health .
stop talking like my mother . that's what she keeps saying .
but it's true . it's a nasty habit . i can't think why i ever started.anyway , it's obviously got you in its grip !
what do you mean ? what are you talking about ?

yes , and i check all the e-mails for mr . thomas .
i take care of the letters . i may read , sort out and organize incoming mails .
so you have to open all the envelopes .
yes , except the personal mail . and i also need to prepare the materials for posting and check the e-mail box regularly .
do you need to file copies of the letters before sending them ?
they're only $ 20 a dozen .
that sounds nice and cheap .
yes , you're saving money because they're on sale today .
okay , give me the roses .
could i interest you in anything else ?
no , but thanks anyway .
oh , really ?
yes , i am a volunteer for the campaign .
i am very impressed .
i feel that history is about to be made , and i want to be a part of it .
that is very nice of you .
will you be voting ?
yes , i am going to vote .
make sure you make it to your polling place early on election day .
no , i'm going alone .
oh , aren't you afraid ?
of course not . for me , mountaineering is both relaxation and a hobby .
i think mountaineering is an exciting sport , but a little dangerous .
wow ! what else does it do ?
i can plug it into a folding keyboard to type in message mode . l can even surf the net .
cool ! anything else ?
yes.with the 600 - second digital memory , l can record my voice and send it using voice message mode .
wow !
my name is james .
what's your nationality ?
american .
what's your relationship with the victim ?
i don't know him .
why did you attack the victim ?
because he beat me first when i tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away .
how many times did you stab the victim ?
i stabbed his belly three times .
did you know hat your actions might cause serous injuries or death ?
i knew , but i couldn't control myself .
was it your intention to kill the victim ?
no . i didn't kill him on purpose , madam . it's him who caused the incident . i need to see my attorney .
my nephew has told me about something called a ' timing deposit ' or something like that ?
a t-i-m-e , time deposit . you can chose from 5 different grades
you get off at the next stop , cross the street and you will find the stop not far on the right hand side .
could i have a transfer , please ?
here you are .
mom , i'll be finished soon .
not too long.cut a little off behind and on both sides , too .
most people do when they travel long distances .
by the way , what's the time now ?
apply some of the ointment , and rub it into the skin .
well , thanks very much .
you seem to have picked up some kind of infection .
what should i do ?
i'm going to clean it up later .
didn't i ask you to clean it up earlier ?
i'm going to clean it .
i want you to vacuum in your room , and don't forget to dust everything .
i know . i'll do it .
make sure you clean it up before you do anything else .
great . can i take it with me now ? or do you need me to fill in some forms or something ?
no , you can take it away now . i just need you to sign here .
here you are .
just one thing before you go , could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the l / c within the validity period ?
i suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems .
i have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me .
maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend and not a boss .
oh , i always have difficulty in getting along with the staff .
just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper .
i think that's a bad idea . i'd hate anyone here to think of me as a friend . how would they ever respect me as they can do whatever they want ?
it's important to do proper exercises .
you're right . too much or too little won't do any good .
the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet .
sounds reasonable .
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .
and fruits !
surely it is . getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .
i've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?
yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can help one to keep sound physical health .
i think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .
the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing !
it's a pun . they use the fish hook to make you think about how you can get hooked on smoking .
i know , but i think it's not really appropriate for young children .
i think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
perhaps you're right , , though . maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow .
i have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but i don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them .
that's a good point . i think i was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that i didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
no , not necessary . usually we have a set form which is printed . we just fill in the printed forms and send it to the person or the offices concerned in the company .
we have tickets for the matinee . it starts at 3p . m .
ok . i ’ ll take it .
where would you like to sit ?
do you have anything in the middle section ? i want a good view , but sitting too close hurts my eyes .
terry and his number is 4562325 8 .
that will work out fine . to make sure everything goes together , do you think this party should be casual or dressy ?
a dressy party would be fun !
that will work out fine . do you think that chinese or continental food would be best ?
we should probably have both .
yes , that will work out fine . should we hire a band or bring in a dj ?
maybe we could do both !
ours are of really good quality .
well , i don't eat any meat , but i do eat fish and eggs .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .
what do you drink ?
well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .
each of the runners that participated the marathon race paid a ten dollar entrance fee . also , they went door to door to get sponsors who pledged a dollar per mile that participants ran . all in all we were able to raise several thousand dollars .
sounds like a great deal for the american cancer society .
i need another savings account .
do you have another account with us ?
i sure do .
would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one ?
that ’ s fine .
how much would you like to transfer ?
transfer $ 100 .
give me a moment while i complete your transaction .
yes . to develop my knowledge , i studied economics , business administration and accountingthrough self-study . nowadays , i have passed three courses on cpa .
have you ever been a student cadre ?
yes . i used to be the monitor of my class .
did it affect you much ?
it ’ s a very important experience for me . first , it improved my organizing ability , and let me understand how to resolve a problem in the overall perspective instead of my own perspective . second , it let me know how to cooperate in harmony with people who i like or dislike .
in your spare time , do you have any part time jobs ?
it's a chevrolet . why do you ask ? you going into the car business ?
nothing like that . my cousin is going to take a job overseas and he can't take his car with him , so he's going to sell it - cheap . it's practically new .
well i have been thinking about getting a newer car . i can't afford a brand new one .
would you like to look at my cousin's car ?
is it a four-door or a two-door ?
it's a coupe with a vinyl roof .
does it have automatic transmission ? .
yes , and it also has power steering , power brakes , and air conditioning .
you'd spend 30 % of your time on the computer . you may be bored with a job like that .
sure , it ’ s josh o ’ neil .
ms . stevens will be with you momentarily . can i offer you something to drink ?
yes , a coffee would be nice , thank you .
i think the only reason is that i was too nervous during the interview and i couldn't express myself the way i wanted to .
what a shame ! you should have showed yourself to them !
it doesn't matter . i'll try other companies .
i suggest you hunt for a job on the internet .
on the internet ? i've never heard of it .
it's very convenient and it has become popular recently .
is that safe ?
of course , if you log on some standard websites .
45 yuan ? it is too much , are you sure ?
it is 45 yuan on the meter .
is there something wrong with your meter ?
no . i am sure about that .
ok . could you give me a receipt ?
you ’ re welcome . i prefer a window seat .
so , what's your beef anyway , lady ?
you just cut into line , in front of me and everyone else , that's what ! go take your place back at the end of the line , like every - one else !
oh sure , lady , and fat chance i'd get a ticket before they're sold out . i'm staying right here , understand ? so be a nice lady and butt out !
just what gives you the right ... ?
because i'm no sucker ; only suckers go to the end of the line . it's as simple as that , lady .
well , you're no gentleman , either .
okay , lady , just to show what a gentleman i really am , i'll let you go in front of me . now , just buy your ticket and shut your trap , will you , lady ?
whew ! i got the last one . this must be my lucky day !
what was that you just said ? last one ... ? hey , they've closed the ticket window !
yes , i'm afraid i bought the last ticket , and to think , if you hadn't been such a gentleman . . .
lady ! this is unfair ! i've been cheated ! i was in line before you.that should have been my ticket ! come on , hand it over , lady !
regular , please .
anything else , sir ? should i check the water and the oil ?
premium , please . by the way , please don't fill it up . two gallons will be fine .
i mean the food for something spicy .
how about some korean food ? there's a place right there on the corner .
these look wonderful . do these come with a guarantee of quality ?
of course . if there is anything wrong with them , you can come back and show me the guarantee of quality , and then you will surely get free service .
i'd like a suite with an ocean view , please .
glad to meet you , mr . white .
miss lu , have you got any experience in restaurant service ?
yes . since i entered college , i have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress .
for how long ?
3 years .
our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers . can you serve them in english ?
that's why i applied for this job . now i am studying hotel english in my college , and i am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette . i am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers .
you must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent .
i don't mind that .
i think i will give you a 3 months ’ trial . the salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus . after that period if we both feel satisfied , a formal contract would be signed .
when am i supposed to start working ?
next monday . bring your resume and diploma with you .
yes , i will . thank you , mr . white . goodbye !
i ’ m thinking about buying this sweater . i know it ’ s june now , but it will be perfect for autumn and winter .
it looks too big for you , but i like the color and the material is good quality . is it on sale ?
yes , it ’ s half price . it ’ s supposed to be too large--that ’ s the fashion .
i might get one too , but in a different color . i prefer light blue to white 。
there.it looks great , don ’ t you think ? i ’ m going to get these jeans as well . i need a new pair . i ‘ m also going to buy this scarf ready for winter .
i ’ m getting this beret ? doesn ’ t it look cool ? i ’ d like to get some jeans too , but i don ’ t have enough cash on me .
don ’ t worry . i ’ ve got my credit card . you can pay me back later .
that's bad ! i've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes , but your line has been busy . will he be back soon ?
i'm afraid not . he's gone for the rest of the day .
is there anywhere i can reach him ?
i don't believe so . he's going out of town on business . may i take a message ?
i have a business appointment with him for tomorrow morning at ten o'clock , but i'm afraid i can't make it .
would you care to make another appointment ?
unfortunately , i'm leaving town rather unexpectedly , and i may be gone for several days .
i see . i can tell mr.thomas that you phoned .
thank you .
which tests do you mean ?
you know . tests like ” how jealous are you ? ” and “ are you a fashion victim ? ”
oh , i see . i like to do those tests , too , but i don ’ t take them seriously .
thank you . is the production line fully automated ?
well , not fully automated .
i see . how do you control the quality ?
all products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process .
what ’ s the monthly output ?
one thousand units per month now . but we ’ ll be making 1,200 units beginning with october .
what ’ s your usual percentage of rejects ?
about 2 % in normal operations .
that ’ s wonderful . is that where the finished products come off ?
no problem .
that's ok . if you want the photo i will mail it to you .
yes , i ’ m pretty sure .
do you have her address ?
yes , i do . it ’ s 109 locks ave , l8v 4n9 .
that ’ s an unlisted number . i ’ m sorry , but i can ’ t give it to you .
i see . thanks anyway .
let me see them . yes . there ’ re ok .
what ‘ s the minimum amount i can deposit in an account ?
you can deposit and ensure amount of ten dollars .
i believe your corporation will try your best and i understand fully your feeling , if your tender conditions proved be suitable for our general conditions of tender , we will accept your submission of tender .
maybe i have asking too many questions today .
that's all right . you can contact me later if you have other questions after you read the tender notice .
fine , thanks a lot . bye !
we decided that we could agree to your price , but we are a bit worried about the slow delivery .
let me see . i quoted your delivery in three months , didn't i ?
yes , but we hope that the wool could reach us as soon as possible .
i thought you would be worried about it . so i rang auckland last night . as you are our biggest customer , they agreed to ship the order on the first vessel available that will leave auckland next month .
good , if you agree we'll draft the agreement right away and sign it then .
sending it won't be necessary . i'm actually coming in for a meeting with my personal banker this afternoon .
what perfect timing !
indeed . is there anything i need to do before i collect it ?
not really . but we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card , just in case there is something you aren't happy with .
i'm sure it'll be fine . how about my pin number ?
that will be sent on to you within 2 working days . then , you can start using your new card .
i ate pizza the other day .
so , what do you feel like eating then ?
how about some burgers ?
i already had a burger yesterday .
what are we going to do ?
we can just each get what we want to get .
that sounds like a plan .
do you know a place that sells pizza and burgers ?
i learnt nursing through theory and practice for 3 years at hunan nursing school .
can you manage english conversation ?
for me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . i always wanted to be an only child so that i could always do what i wanted and so that i wouldn't ever have to share .
don't you think you would miss having other people around ?
no way ! i spent 20 years of my life with relatives around me 24-7 . you know , i don't think i've ever actually spent any time by myself in my parents ' home . what do you think fo the one-child policy
if china didn't have such a policy , can you imagine how many people there would be in china now ?
that's true . but as a woman , i'm glad that even though i don't want any children , i at least have a choice in how many children i have . on the other hand , i can't imagine what china would be like
do you think most families with many children envy or feel sorry for other families with only one child ?
so complicated ! ok , what about this red wine stain ? how do i get it out ?
since this is a white t-shirt , you can just pour a little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick .
cool . then i can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ?
no ! since you are washing delicates and cotton , you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes .
too long , and you do not have much time .
they're over there next to the door . those three with green tags on them .
could you wait a moment ? i have to get a trolley . may i see your room key , please ?
sure , here it is .
it's about a ten-minute walk .
that's very clear . i think i can find my way now . thank you .
i can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high .
i ’ m surprised to hear you say so . you know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years .
we only ask that your prices be comparable to others . that ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ?
well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . but first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly .
the size of our order depends greatly on the prices . let ’ s settle that matter first .
well , as i ’ ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent .
when i say your prices are much too high , i don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent .
how much do you mean then ? can you give me a rough idea ?
to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help .
impossible . how can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ?
i think you are as well - informed as i am about the market for chemical fertilizers . it ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet . may i suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say ?
right ? ok , got it .
then take the next left then the next right . are you with me ?
go three blocks and turn right . it's right there .
should i take the bus ?
no . it'll only take about five minutes to walk .
thank you very much .
but i want to be a tour guide very much because i like traveling and meeting various kinds of people . so i took an evening course at the tourism school of beijing after graduation and i have gotten a qualification certificate .
so you must be an extravert ?
yes , i always enjoy being with a group of people and chatting with them .
what do you think are the responsibilities of a tourist guide ?
a tourist guide must be responsible for arranging and coordinating tour activities , and offering service of transportation , accommodation , sightseeing , shopping and entertainment .
don't you consider it a hard work ?
hard but interesting , i think .
have you any experience as a tourist guide ?
yes , i usually guided foreign tourists around beijing when i was in university .
have you ever learned any other foreign languages other than english ?
do we also need to punch out after work ?
according to the company rule , we should punch in before 8 o ’ clock and punch out after 5 o ’ clock every work day .
how about the lunch break , lucy ?
from 11 thirty to 1 o ’ clock .
may i ask whether we need to work overtime ?
any starch ?
i got hit by a car in an accident .
was there much bleeding afterward ?
no , not much .
well , this doesn't look too serious . nurse , could you please get me a suture set ?
will i need stitches ?
yes . three , i think . it wont ' be too painful . alright , we're done . that wasn't so bad , was it ?
no , not really .
you're lucky there was no lasting damage . i'll set up an appointment for you to come back in five days . we'll take those stitches out then . so long .
don't cry over spilled milk , fred ? could you stay with me a few minutes ?
what ? why ? what's wrong with you ?
i just hate being alone at home with nothing to do about listen to the clock ticking.it ' s so lonely and boring . my sickness makes it worse . when will i recover ?
you will be fine in the couple of month , just be patient . i've got to woke now , i'll be late .
you only care about your work .
sorry , baby , you are everything to me . all i do just for our family .
stay just a few minutes longer , ok ?
ok , i'll leave at 9:15 , is that all right ?
yes .
i'll spent more time with you in the future , dina .
yes , that's right .
how long will you be staying ?
three or four days , perhaps longer .
when i went back to my doctor to hear the results of my lab tests , i tried to keep a poker face even though i was scared to death . then you guess what he said .
that ’ s just what i want to know .
my brother has found his job and my sister is still in college .
what does your father do ?
my father is a middle school teacher .
what about your mother ?
my mother is a housewife .
are you married ?
i am not married yet and i live alone now .
do you need to support your family ?
no , my father and brother are doing that .
have you finished school ?
and the stove is brand new . you know how to use a gas stove , right ?
yes . we've lived in taiwan for a while . i had a gas stove in the states , too .
it's better for cooking chinese food . well , what do you think ?
it's just what i want .
no regrets ?
i am really pleased with it .
i am glad you are happy .
is there any flexibility on that ?
unfortunately , not .
ok . in my position , i think the best way to go would be for the 90 - day loan . that would give us a little more time to sort out the repayment plan .
very good .
on saturday , you'll leave the hotel for sightseeing . miss lu will be your guide .
ok . may i ask what is the reason for returning these products ?
the tv flickers a lot when i am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear .
i see , and what about the keyboard ?
i spilled some coffee on it and now it won't work .
i am sorry mam , but we can only exchange or refund defective products , we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages .
gunpowder , compass , the paper making , and the printing .
i really admire those who made such great inventions !
may , i don't see why they are great . they are just simple things .
they look simple today . but they were milestones in their times .
milestones ? may , you must be kidding .
just think bill gates , those inventions are as important as the windows system .
well , i suppose the ancient inventors made a lot of money out of them .
no , quite the contrary .
why ? didn't you say that they were milestones ?
yes , but they went to the public without any patent protection .
my wife . she suffers from a bad cold .
what symptoms does she have ?
fever and a bad cough .
i see . don't worry , just a common cold .
what kind of medicine does she need ?
patulin will be enough .
how many pills for each time ?
nine pills per day , and three pills after each meal .
thank you very much .
i think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one .
i basically believe in science over theology . i mean , i believe in evolution for example . however , there are many things that science hasn ’ t explained yet .
i ’ m sure that science will explain everything eventually . i think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong .
for example ?
religions preach tolerance , but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics .
it's no use complaining . if we had got enough money , we couldn't put up with it , and would have moved out .
a.this is george .
sure . here it is .
how much does it cost ?
50 dollars .
50 dollars . that's too much .
how about this one ? it's on sale for only 35 dollars .
i don't like that one .
how about the one next to the black gloves ? it's very similar to the one you like .
that's nice . how much is it ?
30 dollars .
that'll be fine .
is this color ok , or would you like a different color ?
that blue one's fine .
do you need any more of these shirts ?
yes .
how many do you want ?
i really feel grateful to you for your reference . they have mentioned this in the job interview .
don't mention it . i think that is because you have right qualifications and nice personality .
thanks again . i will start on next monday . i am sure i will have good performance .
no , but there is one downstairs , which my daughter used some years ago .
it sounds good . could i go and see it myself ?
certainly , you're welcome anytime .
see you later !
( after a while ) good afternoon , mrs . smith . i called you just now .
welcome ! come in , please !
yes .
this way please . your room is upstairs ... here it is .
wonderful ! a modest , comfortable room . ah , a beautiful window , through which i can see a beautiful scene , and hear the birds singing . how nice !
yes , if you want to wash something , there is a separate lavatory room outside .
excellent ! i like it ! when can i move in ?
anytime you like .
you are welcome . i am very impressed by your capability .
is there anything i should do ?
no , nothing . it's thoughtful of you to call me again .
thank you . please call me at any time if you have any questions .
ok , i will . do you have any question ?
no , thank you . goodbye .
i surely will . how much is this wood carving ?
you are an expert on it . that wood carving is very rare . but i'm so sorry . that is not for sell .
that's ok . is anything else recommended ?
do you have any special request ?
i'd like to see some traditional arts .
so that means you are shopping for presents ?
yes , i'm just here to pick out some special presents for my foreign friends .
actually , i think the paper-cuts is ok , because it is easy to carry and foreign friends are also interested in it . they think that is a miracle .
sounds good . i'll take paper-cut .
i have collected different kinds of paper-cuts all over the country , you can pick the one you like best .
you collect them yourself ? i think that you are just doing the wholesale .
as a matter of fact , i open the shop because i'm interested in the arts . i spent lots of time doing research on the folk art of our country .
yes , that's right .
may i have your name and telephone number ?
my name is luo gang , and the phone number is 513-3284 .
mr . luo , will you hold the line , please - - - mr . luo , there is no zhang at that number . will you check the number again , please ?
what the number i gave you , operator ?
it's 2135-3678 .
oh , i'm sorry . should have been 2135-3668 , not 3678 . i've given you a wrong number .
are you sure this time ?
yes .
ok . let me try again .
and please let white color dominate .
ok ! i've noted it down . and any others ?
oh ! i've almost forgot the location was transferred to the a county in the east of the city .
i'll tell them .
well , the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor .
please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise . and we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery .
thanks a lot . and i believe i'll have a good time working with you .
i think so . bye !
that's long leave . how's your project coming along ?
the project i'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . i'd like to take my leave from next monday on .
well , all right . but you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .
thank you , mr.black . there are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . mr.smith will be in charge during my absence . he is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .
great ! i hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .
i've gotten six , i think .
did you pay your fines ?
of course i have .
how much are the parking tickets ?
i think they're $ 130 .
that's expensive .
i just got a parking ticket .
you should probably pay the fine soon .
is it urgent ?
yes , this letter can't go into the mail any later than 5 . it's about a contract .
ok , i am coming .
please take a seat , diana . have you got your spare pens and pencils ?
yes , i have this time . but if i don't understand a word or a phrase when you are dictating , can i ask you halfway ?
no , i ’ d prefer not . i don't want any interruptions every other minute , but you can ask me at the end of the letter .
all right . i understand now . do you think i should leave a margin on every page wide enough for notes and amendments .
of course , diana . you'd better pay attention to the spelling when you type it .
certainly i will , mr . robbins . by the way , may i use a window envelope ?
yes , that's fine . now when you finish these , i want you to put these cards in alphabetical order , using the last names , and then make a list .
you want the cards in alphabetical order using the last names ?
i don't think it can be avoided , to be honest .
perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .
i think it's something that i'll have to consider . the public transport system is pretty good .
it would be better for the environment , too .
i know . i feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .
taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
the only problem is that i'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .
well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . that will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides .
that's true . i could certainly use the exercise !
so , are you going to quit driving to work then ?
sure , for at least three thousand per month .
that'll bring the price down to twenty-five . that's the price we were shooting for .
is that right ? we're very sorry .
i thought it was " the same day " service.anyway , please do hurry .
i'm afraid we can't return it by 11 o'clock .
well , then , would you send it to japan , please ?
that seems alright . what's the exchange rate like today ? good or bad ?
i am james pond from fam company and i am here to discuss it with nova .
do you have an appointment ?
yes , i did it yesterday . our meeting should be 2 pm .
i guess she forgot your meeting . she is attending an important meeting in the company . will you have a seat ? may i leave a memo for her ?
thank you .
i see , sir . can you come back for a fitting on the 10th , that's in a week's time ?
the 10th ? i'm sorry , but you see i'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th . could you have the suit ready by the 8th , or at the latest , the 9th ?
well , a business suit usually takes ten days ' time . but in your case , we'll try to have it ready sooner . how about coming for your fitting on the 8th ? then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th ?
as much as i love this city , i think i'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health .
i know what you mean . however , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . if it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse
what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
i see , so it's similar to global warming ?
they're related to one another , yes .
i heard that some people in england are pleased with the fact that the climate is becoming warmer because it's making their towns a more pleasant place to live .
people joke about the benefits of the increase in temperature , but it's not all good news . they've been experiencing a lot of deadly storms there as well .
people always seem to make jokes as a way to deal with unfortunate situations .
i guess i'll try a chocolate one first.mmmm ... this is delicious.are they hard to make ?
no , they're really quite easy . wait a minute , i've got the recipe right here.see ... these are the ingredients , and then you just follow the directions .
well , i want to stay under $ 100 .
you really shouldn ’ t write it down . you should memorise it . you can change it to a more convenient number if you like .
ok , i ’ ve entered my pin . there are several options on the screen . i guess i just choose which service i want , don ’ t i ?
yes . choose the service you need to use . if you choose to withdraw money , the machine will ask you how much you want .
i can just enter the amount using the key , right ?
that ’ s right . give the machine a moment to process you request . then take your money .
let me check ... yes , we got the october issue a few days ago . it's on that shelf over there .
emily smith .
here is your balance .
thank you . i want to make a withdrawal of 150 dollars .
here you go , miss .
where will you live during the vacation .
in the hotel .
have you made a reservation ?
yes , we have .
which would you like to remit , by mail or by cable ?
what is the difference between them ?
the cable will take less time for your account , in the meantime , the regular service charge is also higher than that of the mail one .
well , i think the cable is better .
ok , please fill in the application form giving the name and address of beneficiary , your name and telephone .
all right . here you are .
everything is ok . the commission is 50 yuan .
ok . you can change it .
what about this one ? do you like this program ?
no , i think it is very boring . can you change it to channel twelve , please ?
yes . oh , it's a talk show .
yeah , it's very funny . have you ever watched it before ?
no , i haven't . this is my first time to watch it .
yes , take the greyhound bus . it will lead you directly there .
how ignorant i am !
the longing tea and the tiger-running spring water are always considered as the “ two wonders in west lake . ”
i know that tea . it smells fragrant .
that's right . all my guests , attention please . we will have half an hour to visit the spring and take photos . and next spot will be the moon reflected in three pools .
certainly . may i ask who ’ s calling , please ?
surely , there are other ways to save money .
i'm glad to hear that . congratulations !
thank you . actually , i could not believe it at first . you know , there're so many outstanding people in our company . many of them are qualified to fill that position .
sure , but you really did great and outperformed the others . you deserved it !
not at all . it was a pleasure . perhaps you will come out with us again while you are here .
yes , i'd love to . thanks again . goodbye .
yes , i do .
when did you buy it from our store ?
four months ago .
i ’ m sorry . you can ’ t return it because too much time has passed since you purchased it . in order to receive a refund , you must return merchandise to the store within 90 days of purchase .
but the direction book says i will get one-year warranty .
yes , i know . after 90 days , you need to call the company that manufactured the vacuum to fix it because it ’ s still under their warranty . their phone number should be in the direction book that came with your vacuum .
okay . i understand . i ’ ll call the customer service office of the manufacturer . thank you .
yes , it's right over here .
great . one last question . where is your jazz section ?
back there against that wall .
oh , i see it . thanks for your help .
ok , the total would be $ 367 and 65 cents.how would you pay ?
by american express , if that's ok .
of course , sir . will you need taxi ?
i am looking for a growth opportunity , which i feel is not available at my current employer . in terms of skills , i am microsoft certified in windows xp and several other operating system
where do you see yourself five years from now ?
your clock never works . perhaps you should buy a new one .
they ’ re in the cabinet above the dishwasher .
and the forks and spoons ?
they ’ re in that drawer .
ok , i know . would you please help me clean the kitchen ?
i really enjoyed our evening together , todd .
i had fun also and was wondering if you would like to go hiking with me in the mountains on saturday .
hiking would be perfect ! may i bring along a picnic lunch for us to share ?
a picnic lunch would be a nice thing to have along .
i'll work on the lunch , and you can work out the details of where we will go . what time will you be at my house ?
nine would be good , don't you think ?
how much do i need for this letter ?
i must weigh it first . err ... it's five grams over weigh , do you want to send it as an ordinary or registered letter ?
i want it registered . how much is it then ?
registration plus overnight ... err ... seven dollars in all .
here's a 10 - dollar bill .
now , your receipt , and the change .
you wouldn't do that . would you ?
i might . vince knows he needs to keep me happy .
4 persons altogether .
ok , i will arrange it for you .
it's supposed to snow early tomorrow morning and then tomorrow afternoon there's a chance of freezing rain .
that doesn't sound pretty .
do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
well , i was going to drive to birmingham to see some friends .
you might want to change your plans . with the cold and wet weather that we're supposed to have tomorrow , the roads are going to be rather slippery .
i suppose i should . i don't like driving in dangerous weather conditions . do you have any plans for tomorrow ?
i just have to go to class tomorrow afternoon .
if you're lucky , it'll get cancelled and you can have a snow day !
if that happens , then i'll invite you over and we can drink hot cocoa and watch movies .
that sounds like fun .
hey , look outside ! it's started to drizzle !
it covers all parts and labour , except for normal wear and tear of course .
what sort of response time do you guarantee ?
our engineers are on call 24 hours a day . we guarantee someone will be with you within four hours , but in practice it's often much sooner .
are there any exclusions ?
as regards salary , i leave it to you to decide after experience of capacity .
well , we'll give you our decision in a couple of days . it's a pleasure to talk to you , mr . liu .
not bad .
i always have the temptation to eat something there .
then , why didn't you do that ?
i don't know how much we can trust them . do you have any ideas ?
some of them , i think , are not good .
it doesn't taste good ?
no , i mean some of them are not clean enough .
that's my greatest concern . but how can you tell which one is clean ?
i judge by appearances .
i got it . i think it's worth trying .
it certainly is .
i'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things .
don't try everything at one time , please .
is there anything in particular you want ?
yes , the perrier and the jim beam hit the spot . let me have three more of each .
got it . anything else ?
i really liked the apples . bring me a couple of apples , please .
not a problem . anything else ?
oh , yes , one more thing
no . you can go to the bank of china to exchange some us dollars at the current exchange rate of the day you exchange them . the maximum amount you can exchange is $ 2,000 .
only $ 2,000 ? are there any other ways to get the money exchanged ?
the only official way is to go to bank of china .
yes , he used to be . but now he ’ s drifting off track .
anything to drink ?
it's already 3 8 o'clock .
but i can see you dance wonderfully well .
thanks for flattering me 。 i think you dance much right ?

you will .
thank you . do you have a credit card , mr . sandals ?
yes , i do . do you accept american express ?
sorry , sir , just visa or mastercard .
okay . here's my visa card .
okay . you're in room 507 . it's a single queen-size bed , spacious , and nonsmoking . is that suitable ?
yes , it sounds like everything i expected .
ok , where can i find their telephone number ?
they are all listed here on this sheet of paper .
is it their home , office or cell phone numbers ?
unless it ’ s marked differently , it ’ s their home numbers .
alright . what if i can ’ t get a hold of them by phone ?
then , you should e-mail them with the information .
where can i find their e-mail addresses ?
they should have then listed on their resumes .
and if there aren ’ t any e-mail addresses ?
then send them a sms on their cell phone .
ok . that sounds easy enough . have you called any of them yet ?
yes . i called the first three people on the list , but they didn ’ t pick up .
did you leave a voice message ?
i left a voice message on one---just for the first person on the list .
i see . what did you tell her ?
i told her that she should call me back at my office number .
ok , so , maybe i should call her again .
yes , that sounds like a good idea . she might not get the other message in time .
one more question . it looks like some of these numbers are long-distance . do you have a calling card that i can use to get through to them ?
sure . you can use this one . the pin number is written on the back of the card .
alright . thanks a lot . don ’ t worry . i ’ ll take care of it .
great work . i ’ m off for the weekend ! see you on monday .
mitsubishi , hp , ibm and many other famous corporations .

yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .
it ’ s such a large firm . do we have our own staff restaurant ?
why not ? i'd love to do that .
here we go . there is a museum of the beijing opera art .
wow . look at this . so delicate and beautiful . did ancient chinese people really wear them ?
not really . they are just opera costumes . do you like the embroidery ?
i surely do . they must have had advanced machine in ancient china to do that .
no , no , no . they are all handmade , girl . you know , the ancient chinese women were supposed to be good at needlework .
what ’ s your name , please ?
that's right . they do not appreciate its value and consider it to be a luxury .
therefore , when enterprises are spending a lot of money in trying to penetrate a new market , they should research whether their products can be sold at high enough a price and in a satisfactory amount .
are you most interested in a good steady job with benefits or one that will allow you to quickly advance ?
i have children so a steady job is important but i would like a chance to advance .
how would you feel about relocating to another state ?
i could not relocate in the next year , but might be open to it in the future .
do you know how much this job offers per year ?
a minimum of 75,000 per year .
i think he'll be back in about an hour at least .
well , may i leave a message ?
yes , of course .
would you please ask him to call chris when he gets back ?
ok . does he know your number ?
i'm afraid he doesn't . my mobile is 139- 2477 - 4026 .
you can pay here .
ok . how much is it all together ?
it is one hundred and fifty . this is your bill .
is the service charge included ?
yes .

yuck !
the deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the pbc .
i plan to take the loan for 3 years .
well , the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years . i'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan .
what about the loan repayment ?
you may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank , for example , payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments .
does that mean i should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest ?
exactly . you are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank .
that's very thoughtful of you . thank you so much .
where do you think you have problems ?
there is no hot water , the bedroom has a broken window , and there are rats in the kitchen .
you know , no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem before .
you are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment .
i will fix these problems when i get around to it .
i will be withholding my rent check this friday unless these problems are addressed immediately .
me , too .

all right .
oh , i like the music on your radio . it's nice .

thank you so much . i'll try and catch that .
the radio has brought us lots of convenience .
yes , i can also learn about the traffic condition through it .
with the development of the society and technology , radio is nearly everywhere .
unusual pet are often more expensive to keep . is that a problem ?
not really . by the way , i don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .
we have those , but i only sell them to people i know well , for obvious reasons . how about a lizard ? i have some that are very brightly coloured , are not aggressive , and are easy to feed and look after .
that sounds ideal . could you show me some ?
sure . come over here . as you can see , i have a wide selection of species . they can live together , if you want lizards of different kinds . do you have a favourite colour ?
i like the red one . what do they eat ?
you can feed them on various things . they will eat small pieces of meat , but i ’ d recommend insects . you can get them from your garden , but remember that lizards eat a lot insects . i sell them here .
thanks a lot . what i ’ ll do si find out more online and drop by next week .

great . thanks so much for your time .
no , thanks .
okay , have a seat over here . how do you want it cut ?
cut it short in the front , but leave it long in the back . leave just a little over the ears .
only as a clerk in a store .
i see . well , consulting is a little different .
i'm a quick leamer , mr.jenkins .
umm hmm.do you have a diver's license ?
yes , and i'm a very good driver .
fine.we provide a company car for our consultants .
do i have to travel a lot ?
oh yes-five days a week.you have to visit customers all over the territory .
but how will i get to know the products ?
you'll have to attend a three-week course . if you do well , the job is yours .
how much is the salary ?

how much commission do your consultants get ?

very good , you majored in international trade ?
yes , i will graduate from the people's university of china this july majoring in international trade.besides , at school , i am a top student.moreover , both my spoken and written english are pretty good .
well , for this position , we prefer experienced employees , those who have just graduated from university , they are supposed to start by working as an intern for at least half a year .
i think i ' m qualified for the job if i can be given the chance.while at school , i once worked as part-time translator in a company and salesperson with a textile company for two years.and i don't mind being paid less from the start , i just want to enrich my experience and competence .
good.that is the kind of man we are looking for.by the way , do you like traveling ? our sales representatives need to travel a lot .
yes , i do . i like traveling very much .
are you willing to work for extra hours ?
of course , i'll try my best.when can i start working ?
what about next monday ?
great.let ' s start next week.thank you , ma'am .
besides , can you take up the hem one inch ?
no , early saturday morning .
we have a flight that we'll put you there at ten am.is that ok ?
nothing earlier ? i prefer flight at nine thirty .
i'm afraid not , unless you want a night flight .
no , exactly not
how about afternoon ?
i'm afraid not . that is our usual practice , because we are sure we will get the right amount of money that way .
what about the cost of delivery ?
i got robbed .
when did this happen ?
it happened this morning .
what was taken ?
my wallet and cell phone .
did you get a good look at the person who robbed you ?
i sure did .
would you able to pick him out of a line-up ?
i don ’ t know about that.with all the uncertainty in the markets right now , it would be a very unwise decision to invest . i don ’ t know if you ’ re aware son , but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently . there have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months , and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy . there ’ s just too much instability . i wouldn ’ t feel comfortable investing in this climate .
but look at it this way , every challenge is an opportunity.and anyway , i ’ m not talking about investing in the domestic market . there are emerging markets that promise great returns . look at china , for example.they have 1.4 billion people , half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class . here alone , the aggregate demand for consumer goods represents an amazing wealth generating opportunity .
come on , son , you ’ re looking at this too naively , the chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability , and their currency has been devalued by almost a whole percentage point .
well , as you know rebecca , in journalism work hours are not exactly nine to five . you could be on call at any time . we do have to work very unsociable hours at times .
well i am used to that , mr . parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me .
good , as long as you understand that .
and when do you need to fill the vacancy , mr . parsons ?
yesterday ! but no , we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month .
kind of , so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah , just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
i want to prove my true value in the electronic industry , and hopefully in the near future i would be promoted to a higher position .
i don't think so . i know i've put on weight this winter .
so you are watching your weight , aren't you ?
yes , i was the top student among my classmates .
how about your oral english ?
all right , sir . they should be ready for you by tomorrow afternoon .
thank you very much .
i got it last week .
how long is it valid ?
it's valid for 5 years . i am planning to do a doctor ’ s degree during my stay there .
good . good luck to you !
i wanted to meet with you to discuss your daughter .
is she acting up in class ?
not at all . she's a joy to have in my class .
is she really ?
she is absolutely wonderful .
so she isn't causing you any problems ?
no . she is actually very intelligent and well behaved .
i'm glad to know that you like her .
i'm afraid not .
one moment , please . i have to check if there are rooms available . i'm sorry , ladies . we have only two double rooms available but they are on different floors . would you mind that ?
we prefer on the same floor because we will probably chat late at night .
then may i suggest a family suite ? we have just had a cancellation .
what is it like ?
it's a big room with a king-size double bed and two single beds . we could also add rollaways .
that's great ! how much is it ?
two thousand hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government government tax .
that's fine .
but ladies , the room is not yet ready . there will be a delay of about half an hour . perhaps you could fill in the registration form first , and then rest in our lobby for a while . we will let you know when the room is ready .
alright , hanks .
ladies , hotel policy requires one night's room charge as deposit .
do you take traveler's checks ?
fine , thank you for coming . mr . wu , please take a seat . i am anne smith , the assistant manager .
nice to see you , mrs . smith .

can you give us a rough idea of the quantity you require ? it is generally known that the price varies according to the quantity .
that is to say , 10000 sets for the one of white-collar and 5000 for men's jackets .
in that case , our offer for the white-collar series is us $ 200 , and the other is us $ 300 per set .
do you quote cif or fob ?
we usually quote on a cif basis and a commission of five percent for you . you will find our price is most competitive .
what are your terms of payment ?
letter of credit at sight .
another question . could you tell me the earliest possible time of shipment ?
within a month after your letter of credit reaches us .
well , i got all the point . all the decision will be made since i get the approval from my supervisor .
can i have one each ?
sure . take as much as you want . they are free gifts from this shop .
is there anywhere i can buy some more cards with beautiful scenery ?
please try the shop there . they might have them .
are their cards free , too ?
yes , that ’ s the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why , how much did you pay for it ?
i bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at helen ’ s boutique . i didn ’ t know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .
of course ! everything at helen ’ s is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why didn ’ t you shop around ?
yes , i have a lot of previous experiences in sales . i worked in sales departments for two companies since i finished my university .
that sounds fine . please give me your name and phone numbers . i ’ ll set up an appointment for an interview for you . it will most likely be in a couple of days . is it all right for you ?
yes , my name is brian and my phone number is 5294870 .
do you want to know where i bought mine ?
where'd you get it from ?
i got it from ikea .
how much did it cost you ?
it cost me a couple thousand for the whole set .
is the furniture sturdy ?
the furniture is built extremely well .
i don't mind paying a lot as long as the quality is good .
the 17th will be fine .
and what date will you be returning ?
hmm , i guess on the 28th .
okay , you ' re booked on american airlines flight 710 , departing jfk at 6:40 p . m . on september 17th . your return flight is flight 711 , departing london ' s heathrow airport at 11:15 a . m . on september 28th .
can we bring drinks by ourselves ?
sorry , sir . it's not allowed in our hotel .
i ’ m not available tomorrow afternoon . how about tomorrow morning ?
i ’ m sorry . dr . galas is fully engaged tomorrow morning . how about the day after tomorrow at 9:30 in the morning ?
that ’ s fine . thanks .
you ’ re welcome . could i have your name and phone number , please ?
certainly . my name is janet smith , and my phone number is 610-555-1234 .
very good , ms . smith . i have scheduled an appointment for you on wednesday at 9:30 am .
thank you very much .
we can have a rest now after this tough interview .
don't be rush . it is suggested to write a letter for the personnel department of future clothes company .
sounds like a good idea . and i think this can leave deep impression to hr . how can we write a suitable letter ?
just to show your gratitude to the chance and tell them your impression on the company . and you can mention some details in your own interview to remind them of you .
at what time was that appointment ?
it was for 4
i can see the appointment that you had . what day do you need to change to ?
i want to change to next tuesday .
what time would you prefer ?
i would prefer three o ’ clock in the afternoon .
what's the charge ?
well , it depends how many pieces of luggages you have .
well , this one is not compulsory . it is just suggestion .
buses are more cramps and you can't walk around .
that's true.but i feel that i see more when i travel by bus .
really ? i think you see more traveling by train .
so which form of transport do you prefer to use ?
i prefer going by train , even though it costs more .
ok , then we'll go by train . i'm sure we'll have a good journey.shall we go to the station and buy the tickets ?
the trains aren't usually full.we can get them on the day we travel.we should buy return tickets , because they are much cheaper than getting 2 singles .
get out of here ! i didn ’ t even know they were dating !
well , i'm afraid it's not at all what i wanted . you haven't really followed my instructions.it ' ll have to be done again .
yes , please . do you take credit cards ?
yes , we accept all major credit cards .
and how about internet access ?
there's free internet access in the lobby .
is it available in the rooms ?
unfortunately not .
that's ok . is breakfast included ?
yes , breakfast is included and parking is available .
fantastic . thank you very much .
well , the riverside mall has 200 stores in it , including four major department stores .
are there small shops near here as well ?
yes , on 4th street , near the movie theater there are many specialty shops , including clothing boutiques .
well , that sounds just wonderful .
but don't you like this place ? i remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely .
well , only you liked it really , darling .
well , you know i have some students studying for their master's degree . one of them tried to give me a gift that kinda made me uneasy .
what gift ?
it's an egyptian carpet . the student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . seeing what gift was , i was really uncomfortable . i mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . i don't think i've done anything to deserve that gift , so i refused it .
you refused the gift ? that's terrible .
i know , but i really can't accept such an expensive gift . i explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . i think he might have taken it the wrong way .
perhaps . he probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
you know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere ? well , it's the same thing .
gee , that's a great idea . now , how much do i have to pay ?
the stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .
great ! now , when can i go down there and use the stations ?
the swim stations are open daily from 7 a . m . to 10 p . m .
boy , oh boy ! i can't wait to change into my swim trunks .
because i want to have a view of the exotic landscapes to extend my views and understanding of the world .
ok . do you plan to go to america all by yourself or with your family ?
myself .
have you finished all you preparation ?
madam , we also welcome you to visit our company . i hope you can also bring your family there to have a look of our company . in this way , we will know each other better .
how many bedrooms and bathrooms do you need ?
we have several generations of family living in our household and so need a very large home .
do you need to be located in a particular school district ?
it doesn ’ t matter , as we do not have any children .
is a view important to you , or would you rather be located on a lakeshore lot ?
in a perfect world , we would like a home with a view of the lake .
all right . and do you want to separate bills or just one single bill ?
separate bills , please .
here is your bill . it comes to 80 yuan . and yours is 60 yuan .
fine . and the charge is $ 100 .
when will it be available ?
i'll pass on the soup , but i'd like a garden salad .
can i get you anything to drink ?
yes , i'd like a glass of iced tea .
okay . i'll be back in a minute with your drink and salad .
i like to be paid more than that . hopefully , 120,000 yuan per year .
that's a little more than we had planned .
i think you'll find i'm worth that .
i can only offer you 110,000 yuan a year . raises will be given after a three-month probation according to your performance . is that satisfactory ?
we have an appointment in half an hour .
i see .
do you have anything else i can have instead ?
well , yes.how about beef stew ? we can serve you at once .
no.but there are quite many cars .
well , suffer then . if you have a toothache , you have to go to the dentist .
it always hurts . i hate going .
stop being such a baby . if it really hurts that much , just let them knock you out .
o . k . , o . k . , i ’ ll go .
well , it's small , but it's a young , dynamic , rapidly-growing company with a progressive , humanistic philosophy .
you didn't read their brochure or anything , did you ?
four times . i'm totally prepared . oh , no ! i forgot to take off my nail polish ! and i have to be there in 15 minutes ! that's it . i blew it .
well , they are progressive and humanistic-maybe they don't care about nail polish ... uh ... even blue nail polish . just keep your confidence up and you'll do great .
but the competition is fierce this year ... and it seems like i'm the only one left who hasn't found a job .
a teriyaki bowl sounds nice .
i don't know how to make that .
all you need to make it is white rice and some teriyaki beef .
that sounds fairly simple , but how do i cook it ?
the first and simplest thing you have to do is make some white rice .
what's next ?
then you should shred your beef and pour some teriyaki marinade over it .
what's the next thing i need to do ?
engaged . oh , dear ! could you tell her it's a long-distance call ?
i'm sorry , sir . i can't interrupt her . i'm sure she won't be very long .
how long do you think she'll be ?
i really can't say how long she'll be .
can i leave a message , please ?
yes , certainly .
can you tell her i'm waiting to speak to her ?
yes , sir . i'll ring her on an inside line if you like .
i received my new card this morning , but i'm unable to use it .
oh ? you mean , the atm machine has eaten it ?
no , it's right here , see ? the atm will not accept it !
you said you received your card this morning , am i right ?
yes . i was told it would be activated and ready to use right away . so , what's gone wrong ?
did you receive your pin number yet , madam ? you see , unless you have your new pin number , to match your new card , you cannot use it . we usually send that separately , around one day after the card , for security reasons .
oh , great ! it's delicious . you see , i am already putting on weight . there is one thing i don't like however , msg .
what's wrong with msg ? it helps to bring out the taste of the food .
according to some studies it may cause cancer .
oh , don't let that worry you . if that were true , china wouldn't have such a large population .
i just happen to have a question for you guys . why do the chinese cook the vegetables ? you see what i mean is that most vitamin are destroyed when heated .
actually , the business trip itself was very successful . we arrived on time , we had nice conversations and we settled some important issues for the next year .
sounds quite fruitful , why do you call it still a nightmare then ?
well , the air line lost my luggage on the return flight and then i lost my carry on bag when i was tackling with the officers in charge . i left the airport three hours later than i expected and then i was caught in a traffic jam . when i finally got home , i was totally exhausted . but i found the elevator was out of service due to a blackout .
this is really a sad story . did they trace back your luggage ?
i am still waiting for their call .
you should've gotten that bill two weeks ago .
i haven't got it in the mail yet .
the computer is showing that all bills have been mailed .
what am i supposed to do about my bill then ?
maybe you should call your post office .
but if it's their mistake , can i get an extension on my bill payment ?
yes , but you will need to send us proof of their mistake .
okay , thank you very much for your help .
i know , but ... hey , stanley's here ! i've been wanting to hear him sing all night .
well , you asked for it . why don't you put on an elvis song for him . he loves " the king . "
this is encouraging news , good for you ! what is your solution , then ?
the most useful method is to make plans and set priorities . it helps me to manage time well and get the most important things done at the first place .
runny nose and coughing .
do you have a fever ?
i have just taken the temperature , i don't think so .
it's not serious .
are you sure ?
yes .
what should i do ?
neither am i . so a small place is ok , but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive . do you mind if it's in a noisy area .
i don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .
good point . ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .
yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .
how much do you think the rent will be ?
kind of , so i made scrambled and soft boiled eggs , some french toast and buttermilk pancakes !
wow ! you really went all out ! did you make any coffee ?
yeah , just the way you like it ! i also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light .
looks good ! i ’ ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice .
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door ?
ok . i will .
i'll have our housekeeper come right away .
i'm sorry i was too tired to fall asleep .
when you woke up , the water was coming out of the tub .
this waitress has really been on top of things , hasn't she ?
yes , this waitress did a great job .
ok , let's see what the damage is . the total for our meal is $ 36.00 .
what do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip ?
fifteen percent is a normal tip , but she really did a great job . what do you think about 20 % this time ?
yes , 20 % would be perfect .
her tip will end up being $ 7.20 plus the bill of $ 36.00 . the total will be $ 43.20 .
yes , that was one fantastic meal !
do you want to type that letter ?
i ’ d rather you typed it .
do you want to tell her ?
hmm . well , in that case , we could go to the movies .
oh , we always go to the movies . can't we do something different ?
well , do you have any suggestions ?
let's see . how do you feel about playing bridge ?
it's ok with me , but we don't have any beer and things .
well , shall i call janet and ask her and tom to come over , and i'll go to the store and buy some stuff .
ok .
well , there are some similarities that come up . because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . but that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here .
right , that makes sense . what's the average age ?
gosh sir , thank you , sir ! i had no idea there were any positions opening up in our department .
well , it's not going to be in our department . i've recommended you for an interdepartmental transfer . there's supervisory spot opening up in financial . i'm turning your name in for it .
management ? wow , i had no idea i could move so quickly from entry level to managerial staff .
i'm returning a cellphone .
was there something wrong with it ?
it's defective .
what isn't working on it ?
it keeps turning off on it's own .
alright , do you have the receipt ?
i have it right here .
i'm going to take care of this and refund your money .
what about the driving license ?
don't you have any other identification ?
i am sorry . i only have my driving license with me .
ok . would you please sign your name on the back of the check ?
thank you . here you are .
how do you want your money ?
would you give me some in twenties and tens ?
what is it ? why did you buy a brick ?
there was a guy on the sidewalk.he had three new boxes , panasonic video camera boxes.he said he had to get rid of them quick .
and ?
so he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . a four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
and it's a brick ?
yes .
i can't believe how stupid you are . why didn't you open the box ?
i wanted to . but he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.if it's opened , other people won't believe it's new .
so he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! it looked brand new .
but why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
he said he had to get rid of them . they were stolen .
aha ! now i understand.you were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.so , what i think is , you deserve to get cheated !
c'mon , don't blame me ! i thought it was a new camera . we could use it.we were even thinking about buying a camera . i don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
that's no problem.he just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . that's easy.and probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.maybe his friend works in an electronics store . they sell video cameras there.probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.so they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.twenty dollars a brick . that's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
mmm .. . x , e , r , 3 , a question mark , and i can ’ t quite make out the other symbol but i think it ’ s the peace sign .
wow , arthur ! you ’ re as blind as a bat !
yeah , i know , my vision is really blurry at times .
ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while i fill out your prescription .
thanks doc !
the service this evening has kind of sucked . is that our server over there ?
i'll go get the check , since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way .
good . i'll just stay here until you get back .
so the total is $ 36.00 for our dinner .
how much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?
i wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .
i kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight .
i think that we should leave 10 % .
africa airline 551 leaves at 9:00 pm .
well , you have to let your flu run its course . you must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery .
but i'm going on a business trip in two days !
i'm buckled up . what's next ?
you need to start the car now .
what do you want me to do ?
go left .
how far should i go ?
i'll let you know when i want you to stop .
tell me before you want me to stop .
all right , try parking here .
i would like to deposit a check .
you need to sign the back .
okay . here you go .
would you like cash back ?
yes , i would .
how much ?
let me get $ 150 back .
here you go .
what is the reason for extension ?
i'll go into a practical training as soon as i receive my master ’ s degree from the university of pennsylvania early next month .
i do have one problem with the apartment .
what ’ s the problem ?
i don ’ t like all those stains in the carpet .
we will have the carpet cleaned before you move into the apartment .
i did not know that .
i assure you that we will , and if there are any more problems , feel free to tell me .
that was the only thing that i saw wrong with the apartment .
i ’ m glad to know that you think the apartment is so nice .
no , thank you . i just had two cups of coffee at my desk .
so , you're a serious coffee drinker .
yes , it keeps me going . sometimes i think i'm addicted .
well , coffee isn't such a bad thing.everyone has to have something.for me , it's cigars . are you a cigar smoker ?
no , i've tried them . but i'm not really a smoker .
well , what would you like to talk to me about ?
i wanted to set up this meeting with you to discuss a little proposal .
i'm glad when people have new ideas around here . tell me about it .
it is about the staff meetings.you know how we have a staff meeting every tuesday .
yes .
well , i have been thinking about it.and i believe we could do things more efficiently here .
what do you suggest ?
the way it is now , the staff from all four branches get together once a week.we meet for one hour . but i think a lot of time is wasted in transportation .
you mean because people have to go across town to get here .
yes . some people spend half of the morning on the road .
that's true . but our staff meetings are very important , arnold . i don't know how we can function without them .
i think they are important too.that ' s why i want people to have a better attitude about them .
i know a lot of people think the meetings aren't too useful . i'm aware of that .
here's what i propose . i think we should meet once every two weeks , but meet for ninety minutes or more .
well .
i also think the meetings should be more focused.and i would be willing to take responsibility for that .
you mean you want to run the meetings ?
no , not really run them . but i could help organize them . i could discuss meeting topics with you , and then prepare a schedule for each meeting . i could then send an e-mail to all the staff to explain the coming meeting.this way the meetings would become more focused , and people would prepare better .
hmm . but we would meet every two weeks .
i really think it would work.the meetings could be longer , and better organized .
i am not against the idea , arnold.it may really be more efficient , as you say . i'll tell you what we can do.why don't we try your proposal for a month , and see how it works .
excellent . i would be happy to get started on it .
yes . we have both the paperback and the hardcover .
what's the difference ?
the hardcover is more expensive .
what's the departure time ?
2:30
well , the afternoon will be fine .
first class or economy ?
first class will be preferred .
well , afternoon flight on december 10th to shanghai . may i have your name , please ?
my name is janice . well , i book this ticket for nova , the marketing manager of pineapple computer company . where can i get the flight ticket ?
it hurts smack in the middle of my gut !
did this just come on suddenly ?
i felt ok until an hour or so ago , and then i just doubled over .
have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently ?
no , and i don ’ t usually get a lot of stomachaches .
we need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is .
i would like to exchange chinese rib for american dollars . do you accept $ 100 bills ?
no problem , we can accept any denomination . how much would you like to exchange today ?
well , that depends on the rate . how much is the rib trading at today ?
it's a shame you didn't come a little earlier , the exchange rate was reset yesterday afternoon . the american dollar is now worth 7.45rmb.if you would like to sell rib , we can give you a rate of 7.35.will that be all right ?
let me see . he's free from 3:00 to 4:30 tomorrow afternoon . can you make it then ?
yes , of course . thank you very much .
but , if we all pushed our way in , nobody could get off , and nobody could get in either .
how many stops are there to the aidan station ?
there are four more stops .
oh , my god !
what's wrong ? you are like a little monkey , on pins and needles !
because i need to use the restroom . is there a restroom on the train ?
no , not on the train , but in the station .
why not ? you told me that subway is a kind of train . if it had no restroom . what kind of train would that be ?
well , that is a question . you want to offer a suggestion ?
oh , yeah , but not today . i am busy with praying the subway may get there as fast as possible .
so ?
you're getting that hot stuff in my mild broth !
i need to take a driver's course .
you'll have to make an appointment .
what do i need to make an appointment for ?
you need an appointment so you can sign the papers .
all right , can i make an appointment right now ?
when are you available ?
can i make it for tomorrow at 9
i can schedule you for that day and time .
i ’ m calling from bell canada . we are currently offering a great deal on long distance calling , only $ 17 a month . with this plan you get 500 minutes of long distance calls each month without any additional charges .
i ’ m sorry . i ’ m not interested in it .
ok . and anything else i can do for you ?
i like a refill please .
okay , sir , let me hit the delete button , and your reservation will be cancelled .
that was nice and fast . thanks .
here's a form to get you started .
my old card is perfect , so all i want you to do is copy it exactly .
i think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card .
... here you go
thanks . come back here next wednesday to pick up your order , please .
i'm sorry , but can you give me a three-day turnaround ?
that's where you'll find things like salt and pepper .
oh , i see .
let's go to aisle 4 to pick up some pasta for tonight .
great ! pasta for dinner .
and let's get a loaf of bread at the bakery for breakfast .
maybe we should get a shopping cart .
okay . i'm going to stay up a while . i've got to go over the household budget . we're a little overspent this month .
please tell tim to close the door to the basement . i don't want the dog down there tonight .
we got lost coming back . i guess i don't really know this town yet .
you got lost . you're kidding !
no . we took a wrong turn somewhere.and joseph doesn't know the town at all . so i started giving him directions.but i didn't really know where we were . so we got seriously lost .
you could have called .
i know i could have . but finally we asked someone where we were .
you've been gone for two hours . how could you get lost for so long ?
guess where we ended up .
i don't know . where ?
when we finally decided to ask someone , they told us we were in grangerfield .
grangerfield ! you were in grangerfield ? that's a completely different town ! how could you drive to a completely different town ?
i don't know.the person we asked had to give us directions to the highway to get back here .
grangerfield is like a dozen miles away from here .
i know it is . i don't know how it happened .
hmm , maybe i do .
what ?
maybe i have an idea how it happened .
how ?
you were too busy looking at joseph , and you weren't paying attention to the road .
it's very good . how do you make it ?
i use a special dressing and homemade catsup .
this salad looks so nice-just right for a hot day .
i'm glad you like it .
you americans usually have nutritious food .
oh , but chinese food is so delicious . i wish i knew how to cook chinese food . do you follow recipes ?
we use different spices but few people use recipes . they learn to cook by experience .
i mostly did advertising planning .
what qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?
i think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .
what was the most important thing you have learned at work ?
honey , you can ask him to be quite . otherwise you may punish him and tell him to stand out of the room , right ?
it started yesterday . i didn't eat any supper .
have you got a temperature ?
i think so . i feel very hot .
let's see . yes . you ' ve got quite a high temperature .
i've got an awful headache , too , and my throat hurts .
hm ... i think you ' ve got the flu .
is it serious ?
no , not at all , but you must stay in bed for three days and take this medicine .
how often must i take it ?
three times a day after meals .
certainly not .
may i turn on the radio then ?
turn on the radio ? what for ?
so that we can sit down together and listen to some music .
listen to some music ? and who ’ ll cook dinner ? will you ?
ok , i will . but let ’ s go to a disco after dinner .
ok .
thank you . here is your tag .
would you tell me the rate per day for depositing my bag ?
sure , madam . only one dollar .
when does the cloakroom close ?
this cloakroom is open until 10 p . m .
oh , dear ! i won't be back until about 11:30 tonight . where can i pick up my bag ?
we will transfer your bag to the lobby floor cloakroom . you may collect it there , madam .
i see . thanks a lot .
6 hours . if you are in a hurry we can develop it in 3 hours .
that ’ s true . if something happened to my husband , i might lose everything . both of us have to work to keep our home , car , and our children ’ s education . i can ’ t afford that by myself .
could we sit and look at the policy i mentioned and see if that ’ s something suitable for you and your husband ?
sure . there ’ s a lot here in this pamphlet .
thank you . and what ’ s the best way to get downtown ?
take the subway . it ’ s $ 1.50 per ride . you can buy a petrol card at the station .

then do the slim pills take effect on you ?
i've quit it already . i go to aerobics class everyday instead .

no , you don ’ t understand , i need this tomorrow morning ! i accidentally spilled beer all over my wife ’ s dress and we have a wedding to attend tomorrow ! she ’ s gonna kill me !
ok , i can have it ready tomorrow afternoon , but this suit is also very stained . i can ’ t guarantee we can remove it completely .
fine ! can you also iron and starch this shirt ?
certainly .
oh , it was nothing . anyone could have done it . i still have a lot to learn yet .
you are very modest . best luck in your new position .
well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy .
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .

some books and newspapers .

is it all right ?

100 frances .
mmm , it is reasonable . look at this set of table wear , it is so beautiful !

you are right .
i will take the tapestry , the set of table wear and the vase .

it must be interesting .
in that case , you should go to the baggage hall over there .

about 3 minutes .
does he have any other complaints ?
three days ago , he began to cough , sneeze and have a running nose . yesterday , he began to have a fever .
have you taken his temperature ?
it was 38 ° c this morning and it was 39 ° c just now .
let me examine him to see if there is any rash . no rash .
is it serious ? is it meningitis ?
no , it is not meningitis . just a high fever and convulsions , which results from a virus upper respiratory tract inflection .
does he have to be admitted to hospital ?
no . no need for admission . i'll give the baby analgia nose drops to bring down the temperature first . then i will give you a prescription . the pink tablets are used for his fever . when his temperature is over 38 ° c , give him one tablet . the other tablets are sedatives for his convulsions . the white liquid is for the cold . give the baby plenty of water to drink .

one more from carla .
a playpen and crib ! thanks carla ! this is just what i needed !
ok , that ’ s all of them . no more gifts . now who wants to guess when the baby is due ?
sure . it's probably the skiing show . adam told me there were many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors .
see that . it's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that .
hey , don't be so pathetic . it's a maximal sports show . what else can they do to attract more visitors ? stop all this fuss and enjoy the show .
you are right . but what if the avalanche happened ?
they are all very experienced and great skiers . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .
anyway , the show is breathtaking . by the way , where did they get so much snow in here ?
don't you know that ? are you kidding me ?
hey , not everyone is as lucky as you to have a father who is a scientist .
sorry . well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .

i would , if my washing machine wasn't broken .
why don't you just get it fixed ?
i can't afford it .
so you plan on washing your clothes here from now on ?
that's my only option right now .
we have nothing on sale today . but we're having a big sale next weekend .

do you know how to do it ? i am not so good at machine things . i will have somebody do it as soon as possible .
with that understanding , you can figure out what your company is looking for in terms of basic attitude . right ?
i think that they are a very formal company .
what you wear is important . so keep in mind what is suitable for the company and type of work you will be doing . need help ?
i need a lot of help in this area .
in addition to clothes we need to think about other basics , ok ?
yes , what else should we think of ?
yes , here you go . i don't need a visa to go to spain , do i ?
fortunately for you , you don't . next time , if you have any questions about visas , you should try to find out before you get to the airport .
that's good advice .
would you like a window seat or an aisle seat ?
are there any seats available by the emergency exits ?
let me see here ... yes , there's one left .
ok . i'll take that one then .
alright . how many pieces of luggage are you checking in ?
i like to travel light so i just have this one .
if that's your only piece of luggage , it is small enough to carry on with you . would you like to do that so you don't have to wait in luggage reclaim once you arrive ?
yes , please . that's a fantastic idea . which gate do i need to go to ?
look at this one . it's our biggest pan .
yes , that is big enough , but it's too heavy for me .
okay , we have the same thing in aluminum .
oh , this is nice and light . but it has an aluminum handle .
try this one . same aluminum pan , but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle .
oh , yes . this is very nice . i'll take this one .
that's a good choice . how do you want to pay for it ?
cash . oh , i almost forgot . i need a lid , too .
ok . thank you . where should i buy them ?

great . what floor is the pharmacy on ?

yes , i love to see the animal show .
i have never seen those before , but since you're so excited it should be good .
i'm sure you'll love it .
excuse me . what are these charges ?
oh , these are the phone charges and these are for something from the bar .
wait a minute . i made a phone call , but i never made a connection .
i know , sir . those aren't telephone company charges . those are hotel charges .
isn't that a bit excessive ?
i'm sorry , sir . it's our policy .
ok . here is the money .
size 41 . i want something in dark flannel .
how about this one ?
it feels all right . but if it were a darker color , i'd like it better . this seems too light for winter . do you think you could get me one ?

it looks good . but can i try it on ?
of course . let me help you .
thanks . it's comfortable . well , how much is it , please ?

thanks for your trust . owing to my colleagues ' help , i've successfully completed my task .
you are very modest and diligent . the distribution of bonus derived from the performance evaluation . you deserve it .
great ! and , how are things in your neck of the woods ?
things are so great here . i almost smiled myself to death last week . one of my coworkers had to give me cpr .
oh.jack , i have missed your sense of humor.ha ha ha ! nobody else sees things quite like you do.it ' s your gift .
or a curse .
nope , it's a gift.anyway , we need some more of those mid-range speakers you tricked me into buying last time .
that , my dear , was classic sales technique delivered by a professional .
are you still gouging your customers the same price per unit ?
heck no , we doubled the price , but because it's you , i'll let you have'em at 50 off .
you silver-tongued devil . can't you ever just answer a question with a simple yes or no ?
i think you should stay in the airport . even though the delay is expected to be two hours , the flight departure could be announced any minute . who knows ?
what seems to be the problem ?
it seems there are some loose bolts on one of the wings . it happens all the time . no need to worry .

for protection . some relics will turn to dust if exposed to air .
so there isn't air in the glass boxes ?
no , there isn't . they are all vacuumed .
i wonder how old these things are , thousands of years ?
yeah , they all come from a very ancient time .
hey , look at the three-leg cup . i've seen it on tv .
the bronze cup was made 4,000 years ago . it's priceless !
yeah , it has no value at all . who will use this cup today ?
danny , priceless means so valuable that you can't put a price on it .
no , thanks .
all right . that'll be $ 12.50 . your pizzas will be there in 30 minutes .
not just yet . i have one or two questions . how much for a single ?
during the peak season , a single room goes for 50 dollars on a night . but we ’ ve got a single super saver special going on right now – only $ 30 a night . and we ’ ve also extended our checkout time 00 in
that ’ s a good deal . since this is a working trip , i wonder if you have meeting rooms where i can get together with some clients .
yes , we have five meeting rooms , of various sizes . we can accommodate large meetings and small , informal gatherings as well . of course , if you have many small meeting , you might consider checking
that sounds great . do you accept checks ?
you mean the room thirteen-thirteen ?
i'm not sure , but i think so . i'm very exhausted , but i can't sleep .
all right , ma'am . i'll check and tell them to be quiet .
i agree . as long as the food is not too bizarre once i saw some people eating insects . that is frightening .
sure it is . is it convenient to get there by plane ?
you need plenty of fruits and vegetables , small amounts of protein , and whole grains .
are there certain things that i should avoid ?
you shouldn ’ t consume too much sugar or caffeine . also , watch your intake of fatty food .

we really don't need to .
you are a good wife , julia . but you must take care of yourself .

i can also speak a little japanese .
i am very satisfied with your answers .
please fill out the form first .
ok , can you bring me a new one ?
alright . i'm sorry , miss . according to our file , this prescription has already been refilled twice .
i was worried about that . i couldn't remember if i had it refilled twice yet or not .
well , it looks like you have.you will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription .
listen . this is an emergency . i tried to call my doctor , but he is out of town . so i can't see him in time . i need this medicine . it is for skin condition . i've run out.can you just refill it once more ?
i'm sorry , miss . we can't do it . we must follow the prescription.and this prescription has run out .
but i need it . please . refill it for me just this once . i can go to the doctor around ten days from now . then i'll have another prescription .
miss , i understand your problem.but it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription.it ' s the law . i can't do anything about it.we never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription . never .
but i have a prescription . i just need more of it .
a prescription must be valid . it cannot be an expired prescription . i'm sorry , miss . it's the law.you will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you .
oh , it will be so expensive ! i have a special medical plan , and i can only see one doctor.it will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor .
miss , i just can't help you on this . i'm a pharmacist , not a doctor . and there are other customers i need to help now . i know it is frustrating when this happens.but there is nothing i can do about it . i'm sorry .
this is ridiculous ! in taiwan , it is much easier to get medicine when i need it .
yes , but we shouldn't get any thing too big . remember it has to fit in with our living room furniture .
that's right . now this one looks alright ? it's a detached or do you prefer this one ? it's sony .
i never have seasonal allergies .
consider yourself lucky .
what are all the symptoms ?
well , as you just saw , i sneeze a lot . also , my nose becomes very runny , my throat sometimes itches , and my eyes start to water .
that doesn't sound good .
no , it's not . so you don't have any type of allergies ?
well , i have a severe allergic reaction to alcohol . it runs in the family .
everyone to some extent is allergic to alcohol .
i get it pretty bad . my whole face turns red , including my ears . my eyes become bloodshot , and i start to itch all over my body .
that's pretty bad .
the train is coming . there are a lot of people waiting here . let's stand in a better position to get on the train
well , it's not as crowded as we expected , is it ?
what about cats ? they are more independent .
actually , i was thinking of something a little more exotic . i don't want a common pet like a dog or a cat .
how about a lizard ? are lizards more along the lines of what you were thinking of getting ?
yeah , are they easy to look after ?
no , not really.but i think it should be something distinctively chinese . and easy to carry .
i would suggest you buy paper-cuts , embroidery and batik.they are very easy to carry .
brunch ?
it is a meal that combines breakfast and lunch . on sundays , many americans sleep late and go out for brunch . those who go to church without having breakfast have brunch also .

sure , that ’ d be great.where would you like to go ?
anywhere with you .
that's right . if you like hot dishes , you could try some .
they might be too hot for me .
then there's the cantonese cuisine and the kiangsu cuisine . most southerners like them .
what about any special beijing dishes ?
there's the beijing roast duck .
oh , yes . i've heard a lot about it . i'd like very much to try it . where can i find it ?
you can find it in most restaurants , but the best place is certainly quanjude restaurant .
is it near here ?
not too near but not too far either . a taxi will take you there in 15 minutes , if the traffic is not too bad , i mean .
well , thank you for your information . but what is the name of that restaurant again ?
let me write it down on this slip of paper for you . you can show it to the taxi-driver .

not bad . i heard you are going to graduate this coming summer , right ?
yes , that's why i'm here . i'm thinking about buying a second-hand apartment .
did you go to a real estate agent ?
no , that will be too expensive .
that's true . by the way , what kind of apartment are you looking for ?
my first job's salary will be a bit low . so the cheaper the better . just one i can afford .

yeah , that would be great . thanks .
no worries . i just for her card . and you can get her from email . i would really like to talk to her again . i kind of miss her a little this days .

why ? i still wanted to talk to you .
i have things to do .
like what ?
don't be nosey .
i'm not . i just want to know .
well , it's really none of your business .
that's harsh .
i'm sorry , but i have to go .
and must i go back to school ?
no , you needn ’ t do that . you ’ d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes .
but dad , i should be working full-time at my age . i ’ m nearly 17 .
you ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ’ t have failed your exams . you have to take a job and study .
what else i ’ ve got to do ? join the army ?
i come from the city of tangshan in hebes province .
you're from tangshan ? i can't believe my ears . i was also born in tangshan , but i was brought up in beijing .
really ? it's nice to meet you . how long have you been with this company ?
just over 4 years now . since this is your first day here , i'm sure you don't really know too much yet . let me show you around , so you can introduce yourself to everyone .
let me see . i can come out and see you first thing wednesday .
that would be our saver's plus account .
4.5 % , that's good . how much money do i have to keep in it to get that rate ?
you have to maintain a balance of $ 10,000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 % .
all right . i ’ ll open one of those .
just fill out these forms , and i ’ ll be with you in one second .
outlets give good deals .
thank you so much .
which do you prefer , color or black and white ?
the last one is black and white , all the rest should need color .
ok .
i hope they will come out well . when should i pick them up ?
they will be ready at noon tomorrow . each negative develops one print , right ?
yes , it is . and develop them as glossy as possible .
no problem . do you need another film ?
yes , a roll of kodak film please .
i have the same question . i can ’ t send out mails . we ’ d better call the it department and ask them to check it immediately .
i understand . it's good you came to the emergency room .
let me see a doctor .
i'm sorry , sir . you will need to wait at least a short time.we are very busy tonight . there was a big car accident on highway 106 .
i thought this was the emergency room .
it is . but unless you are critically injured , you still need to wait.you aren't bleeding , are you ?
no . only a little . i fell off my porch .
oh , that's terrible . is it your right arm or your left arm ?
my left arm .
can you fill out this form then ?
no , i can't . i'm left-handed .
that's very inconvenient for you then.you ' ll probably have a cast on your left arm .
yes . but why do i have to fill out a form anyway ? this is the emergency room .
yes , it is . but even in emergency rooms there is some paperwork to be done.have you ever been in an emergency room before ?
no . just let me see a doctor . i'm worried about my arm .

do you have your insurance card with you ?
no , i don't .
well , you can call it in later . you can phone us .
can i sit down now ?
this cafe offers a wireless internet connection . that means i can get on the net for free while i ’ m here . of course , i have to buy a cup of coffee !
that ’ s great . can you do it anywhere ?
no . you can only do it when the cafe offers a wireless connection . there are only about 10 or 12 places that offer it in this city .
so , what programs do you have on your laptop ?
i ’ ve got all the usual ones for word processing and then i have a few for creating and editing photographs .
i know you are keen on photography . it ’ s very useful for you to be able to download photos from your digital camera . then you attach the picture files to emails and send them to anyone , anywhere , at a
what an excellent idea !
shall we do some jogging ?
ok .
i feel well now .
yes , some exercise is necessary for us .
great ! we are going to be working in teams of three . are you ok working with others ?
yes , i like working like that .
we will begin next monday . would you be available then ?
yes , i can be there .
well , if you could send me your basic background information before next monday , it would be useful .
ok , i will send the information to you .
well , just saying that you wanted to get promoted is not enough , you need to write down your desirable position and an available plan for achieving that adjective . don ’ t be afraid of taking challenging . they might be opportunities and failing is not fatal . you learn more from that actually . sometimes , you need to fail to be successful .
how do you think if i volunteer for some work ?
are you in a hurry ?
yes , i have to be there to meet a friend at 5 thirty pm . so we're sure we can get there on time ?
i'm afraid not , sir . generally we can , but you know how it is in the rush hour now .
i see . here's the extra 5 $ for you if you can get me there on time .
all right . i'll do my best .
oh.we made it . thank you . how much do i own you ?
the reading on the kilometer is 12 $ .
here's the money , keep the changes , please .
do you need a receipt ?
i couldn't find the files you request , even though i checked all the cross-references . i don't think it's there .
i am sure that document was filed .
well , let me check again under a different heading .
good idea ! it seems that i asked you to put it in nova's files .
ok . give me one , please .
here it is .
thank you .
what ’ s your polling place ?
my polling place is at the park up the street .
oh , yeah ?
yeah , where is yours ?
i don ’ t know .
how is it you don ’ t know ?
the location of my polling place never came in the mail .
you can always just check online .
you didn't see the red light ?
i'm sorry for running it , but i really didn't know .
didn't you learn that red means stop ?
i know that .
then tell me why you sped up on the yellow light .
i'm not sure .
i'm giving you a ticket for this .
i'm sorry for the misunderstanding .
this is li ping of abc computer company limited . i'm calling on our mr wilson the general manager of our company .
i'm sorry , mrs li , mr brown is now in a meeting.may i have your number , and ask him to call you back later ?
i'm afraid mr wilson would like to speak to mr brown right now.he ' s got an urgent matter to discuss with mr brown without delay .
ok , then would you please hold the line ? mr li , the line is through , mr brown is ready answering the call , go ahead .
thank you for your assistance , mr bush .
ok , thank you very much .
alright , what's in them ? they are so heavy !
just things we need for the picnic tomorrow .
well , hurry up and open the door please . i told you these things are heavy .
i'm sorry , but i just can't find the key . you must have it .
there is no way that i can fall asleep right now .
try listening to some soft music .
it won't work . i'm nowhere close to being tired .
i really don't care , just go to sleep .
what if i stay up and do something , until i get tired ?
you'll be up all night if i let you do that .
i'm going to get to sleep eventually .
you need to go to sleep now , so go to sleep .
go and try it on .
what do you think ?
i love that shirt on you .
what about the jeans ?
they don't really fit you right .
i don't think so either .
that blouse is absolutely wonderful on you though .
well , i'll just buy the shirt .
yes , of course . well as you can see from the resume i ’ m 27 and grew up in brooklyn , new york , although our family moved to london when i was quite young , at around sixteen .
ah i see , so you were actually educated in europe ?
yes precisely . although i was born in the us , i would definitely call london home . but as you see i ’ ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . my father was in the oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in saudi arabia too .
very interesting . so it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .
absolutely ! we were never still for too long . but now i ’ m really looking to settle down .
we directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received .
that seems very impressive . good work !
i feel run down , tired . i've been having headaches almost every day . and i'm not getting as much sleep as usually do .
have you been eating properly ? eating the right kind of food is important for your health , you know .
well , i haven't been eating well , i guess . i usually only have enough time to grab a sandwich and a cup of coffee for lunch .
and what about dinner ?
sometimes i'm too tired to eat anything at all .
that's not good . you don't have a well-balanced diet . have you been taking vitamin pills ?
that would be great .
when do you want it delivered ?
i need it delivered tomorrow . will that be possible ?
what time exactly ?
i need it delivered at 12 o'clock .
we can have it to you at that time .
that's not a problem ?
we will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock .
oh , to rent .
how much do you want to pay ?
about 300 a month .
well , i've got one here . it's 260 a month .
how big is it ?
it's got a kitchen , a bathroom , and one bedroom .
well , actually i prefer something a bit bigger if that's possible .
yes , i think so . there is also an interesting one.it ' s opposite the park .
how much is it ?
it's 325 a month . it's the biggest we've got in this area .
what's it like ?
well , there're two bedrooms , a sitting room , a kitchen and a bathroom .
it sounds interesting . can i go and see it ?
all right , who should i send them to ?
it ’ s sent to mr . charles . i believe he is in london .
ok , home or office address ?
office address , please . he might be at work when they arrive .
should i enclose this commercial paper with these two letters ?
he does . he ’ s good at this genre too . it ’ s a captivating read .
we ’ re going to the bookshop . would you like to join us ?
yes , i would . i need to buy a textbook for my course and , as you know , i love browsing through the latest paperbacks .
me too . i need something to read on the flight to new york . i can never sleep on planes . sarah wants to pick up some children ’ s books for her daughter .
i want to look at nelson mandela ’ s autobiography .
did you do anything that might have aggravated your tooth ?
you know , i was eating jawbreakers in the movies the other day , and i accidentally bit down really hard on one .
what kind of toothbrush do you use ?
i just use a regular hard bristle toothbrush .
does it bother you when you eat something really cold ?
good.we ' re tired after driving all day , and we're looking forward to relaxing in a comfortable room .
this room has two double beds.it ' s number 56 at the rear of the motel.it ' s quite a comfortable room .
how much is it for one night ? we only need it for tonight.we ' re going to continue our trip in the morning .
it's forty-five dollars a night for two.is anyone else traveling with you ?
no , it's just the two of us .
would you like to pay for the room in cash or with a credit card ?
credit card.we don't like to carry much cash with us on our trips .
please fill out this registration card.here is your key.you can park your car in front of our room.check - out time is noon .
thank you very much .
that will make him so happy .
i'll get him one of those little dogs .
one that won't grow up too big .
and eat too much .
do you know which one he would like ?
oh , yes , i took him there yesterday . he showed me one that he really liked .
i bet you had to drag him away .
he wanted to take it home yesterday .
is there anything else ?
there are a mouse and a camera .
is that all ?
yes . how much is it to send these things to shanghai by regular delivery ?
it depends on the weight of these things . generally speaking , we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram .
i see . can you weigh them for me , please ?
please go over there to weigh them .
if he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won .
what ? what kind of drugs was he using ?
he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .
i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
they are . the reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
that's so disappointing . i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
i don't think it's right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !
regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .
i agree . hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .
i don ’ t understand .
i ’ ve never used one before .
i can help you figure it out .
what do i have to do ?
slide your card into the machine .
then what ?
you need to type your pin in .
what do i have to do next ?
did you reconfirm the plane reservations for all the taiwanese guests ?
not yet , i was busy getting that videographer who films stuff for the net .
cool ! i can't believe he agreed to go all the way to dallas with us !
you are right . how about paintings and embroidered handkerchiefs ?
sounds good . may i have a look ?
of course . these paintings have many designs , such as animals , flowers , landscape , aquatics and so on .
they are beautiful , but i can't understand the connotation in them . let me see the handkerchiefs .
all right . chinese embroidery is one traditional art with elaborate design and high quality .
oh , i like the bamboo design . what is this ?
this is a series of animals , called chinese zodiac .
good . so i will take three series and five bamboo ones .
certainly . go along queen's road ...
along queen's road ...
yes , and turn right at the hilton hotel .
right at the hilton .
then go up garden road , past the cathedral .
the cathedral ?
yes . then cross the road at the next traffic lights . the peak tram is straight ahead . you can't miss it .
that's very kind of you . thank you . er ... have you got a pencil ?
yes . why ?
how about karlis ?
are you kidding ? that place is too ritzy for lunch .
true . ok let's go to grumose ?
same thing , meals there all coarsen arm and leg .
i guess it is a little pricy .
let's stop it at multicolor for a quick lunch ..
that will be ok . come on , i can't wait to chow down .
that was a great lunch , the food was good , but the service was lousy .
is that why you stiffed the waiter ?
the kind that never goes out of fashion , i guess .
i think you should realize that even the most conservative style changes .
i'm sure you're right . i just dread the idea of making a new suit every year .
the changes are usually not that dramatic . we just got some pictures of the latest fashion . would you like to take a look ?
good . i think i'll choose this single breasted one . when can i get it ?
next friday .
firstly , you must always show your best to the interviewer . and secondly , try to avoid spamming through e-mails , because this will make the reader go crazy . the last but not the least , there is no substitute for pounding the pavement in such a digital age .
i understand what you mean , and i will not upset myself . face it .
really ? i have been there several times .
are there many employers ?
yes . the personnel market is a place specially for job-hunters and employers .
so there will be many large companies in the personnel market , right ?
yes , there are many famous corporations .
when will there be a job fair ?
every saturday and sunday
do i need to pay to go into the personnel market ?
no , it's free .
how about going there to have a look now ?
$ 12 .
can you make it any cheaper ?
it is cheap .
i'll take it if you give me a discount .
$ 10 . that's the best i can do .
we have discussed it and decided that at the moment we would like the salaries to be paid into the employees's accounts , whether they are currently with this bank or not .
that's not a problem .
of course , if we are happy with the service after the initial period we will recommend all employees either transfer their accounts to this bank , or open new accounts with you .
we need to find a good realtor .
not necessarily . if we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .
what do you mean ?
realtors always get a commission.if the realtor helps us find something , we have to pay him .
but doesn't a realtor help with the contract ? i thought they take care of all the legal troubles .
yes , that's often true . but you have to pay them .
i still think we should have a realtor.we ' re new in this country . we don't know all the laws of buying a house.and also , the realtor will inspect the house.he can tell us if the house has
of course we need a home inspector.but we can hire an inspector on our own.and as for the legal problems , i have friends . they can help us .
so how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor ?
it takes a little more time . we have to check the ads in the paper.probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads.then we have to drive to the homes and look at them .
and doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . it's best to find someone who is selling by themselves .
why ?
because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.he will have to pay a commission to the realtor .
hmm . it all sounds very complicated .
it is . but buying a house is very important . so it takes time.that ' s why we haven't done it yet . it's very troublesome .
i want to look in the papers today . maybe we can see something we like .
oh , very nice . how long will you be in beijing ?
probably another week .
oh , i see . well , i ’ ll give you my phone number and if you need a guide , please call me .
how did you spend the night there ?
we pitched a tent in the night , waiting for the sunrise . wow ! it was too beautiful .
i had a similar experience , but that was on the top of tasha mountain in my country .
tasha mountain ? it's very famous in china , isn't ?
yes . it is one of the five mountains .
i want to climb tasha mountain this summer vacation . would you be my guide ?
no , this is the first time on a plane . maybe you are right .. please get me some pills .
ok . i will get some for you . there's an airsickness bag behind the seat in front of you.please wait me for a moment . ( go away for a few minutes , and now she comes back . ) here are two pills . and the water is in the glass too.please take the pills with water .
thank you very much . ( take the pills . )
are you feeling better now ?
much better now . thanks again .
would you show me some ?
of course .
they really smell fragrant . how much is a real sandalwood fan ?
the small ones are one hundred yuan for each . and the big ones are two hundred and thirty yuan .
i'll take two small ones and a big one .
what else are you interested in ?
i'm afraid not .
she's very fond of detective stories ?
i see.has she read any detective stories ?
oh , yes !
do you know if she's read this one ?
i'm not sure , but she probably won't remember if she has ! she's very forgetful !
ah ! she has a bad memory.how old is she ?
she's eighty-seven .
i suggest you take this book.it ' s very exciting .
i know , i know.but my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes . it's the series finals , and i wouldn't miss it for the world !
really ? what's the series about ?
well , it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in america . it's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny . i think you'd like it .
it sounds interesting , but i am not a big fan of tv shows . they're time consuming and don't have much depth .
i believe some shows are quite informative and interesting . take this show for example , it examines american xenophobia and how it might conflict with the american dream , with hilarious results .
really ? that's interesting !
yeah.oh , here it comes ! why don't we watch it together ? they are going to have a court debate in this episode . it should be good .
then will you put all the towels under the bathroom door .
ok , i will .
i will have our housekeeper come right away .
i am sorry , i was too tired to fall asleep .
when you woke up , the water was coming out the tub ?
here you are — she's called digital barbie .
oh , i like digital barbie ! how much does she cost ?
this barbie is only $ 29.95 .
that's perfect . let me have her .
very good . is there anything else you would like ?
no , that'll do it for now .
including tax , your total will be $ 32.42 . cash or charge ?
let me give you cash , please .
no , sir . nothing except my personal belongings , such as clothes , notebooks and some gifts .
any cigarettes or liquor ?
i have cigarettes for my own use .
i think you'll have to pay some duty on these cigarettes because they exceed the quota . and this article is liable for duty .
how much duty should i pay ?
one hundred dollars .
here is the money .
just a moment . i'll make out your duty memo . ( writing and giving the memo to mr . green ) take it and pay the girl over there .
yes .
i won ’ t beat around the bush . sir , i would like a raise . i currently have three companies after me and so i decided to talk to you first .
a raise ? son , i would love to give you a raise , but this is just not the right time .
i understand your position , and i know that the current economic downturn has had a negative impact on sales , but you must also take into consideration my hard work , pro-activeness and loyalty to this company for over a decade .
taking into account these factors , and considering i don ’ t want to start a brain drain , i ’ m willing to offer you a ten percent raise and an extra five days of vacation time . how does that sound ?
great ! it ’ s a deal ! thank you , sir !
before you go , just out of curiosity , what companies were after you ?
how ’ s that ?
i sent in an absentee ballot .
why ?
i won ’ t be able to vote on tuesday .
why not ?
i have to work .
why don ’ t you go to work late ?
i have important business to take care of that morning .
i feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and i am very interested.what ' s more , your company is outstanding in this field .
what makes you think you would be a success in this position ?
my graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job . i am sure i will be successful .
how do you know about this company ?
what's so interesting about it ?
well , this guy fell asleep on the sofa and when he woke up , half his face had been bitten off !
what ? how did that happen ?
they think his dog was trying to wake him up and couldn't , so ended up biting him in his face .
wow . what does his look like now ?
it looks pretty frightening . he doesn't have any lips , so all you can see are his gums and teeth . most of his nose and chin are missing too .
what did he look like before his dog bit his face off ?
he was actually quite handsome . what a shame .
what's he going to do now ?
have you used any hotel services this morning or had breakfast at the hotel dining room , mr . green ?
yes , my friend and i just had breakfast at the dining room , but we didn't use any services .
how about the charge for the days you shared the room with your friend ?
please add to my account .
the total for the eight days is five hundred sixty yuan .
you need change .
the machines take change ?
yes . it costs fifty cents for the washer and a dollar for the dryer .
where do i put the money in ?
you put the coins into the slot , push it in , and it will turn on .
that's it ?
there's nothing else to it .
thank you very much .
thanks . do you sell aspirin here ?
yes , our over-the-counter medicine is over there on that shelf .
oh , i see it . do you have multi-vitamins ?
yes , right over here .
( the customer gets the aspirin and vitamins . ) that'll be $ 16.00 .
here's a twenty .
the plane must fuel before flying to paris .

very well . i hope you'll enjoy your stay in china .
no problem . your room numbers are 201 and 204 .
i am on a diet . and i do more exercise regularly .
what's the secret then ?
it lies in perseverance .
well . it's hard for me . i can't keep doing exercise .
ok . we offer a few different kinds of postal saving services . they have different interest rates .
i want the one with the highest interest rate .
that would be our savers plus account . you must pay 10 000 yuan into your deposit account . in this way you can get 5 % dividend at the end of the year .
all right . i'ii open this one .
just fill out these forms , and i ’ ll be with you in one second .
ok . how about dongpo meat ?
all right . i'll take it .
do you like to use chopsticks
yes , i like using chopsticks .
do you like some soup ?
yes , but i don't know what soup you have .
we have beef soup and tomato soup .
good . i prefer beef soup .
according to usual practices , we serve dishes first and then soup . if you like we'll bring you some soup first .
save it until you've served dishes .
it ’ s to the east of tiananmen square .
thank you .
could i see your driver's license ?
sure here it is .
well , is there any other hotel nearby ?
yes , the sunset hotel is three blocks away . maybe you can ask them .
of course not , i appreciate that .
well , it has nothing to do with virus . the problem is your attachment is a bit larger . it has exceeded the e-mail capacity .
i see . what can i do now ?
yes . what's this made of and how to wash it ?
i eat more fruits and vegetables and limit amounts of fatty and fried foods .
and ?
i drink milk every day . it's really good for building strong bones and teeth . i drink tea quite often , for it's protective against kidney cancer .

if you enter this company , what section would you like to work in ?
if possible , i'd like to be positioned in the international trade department .

oh , thanks all the same .
why , of course . here are some that will show you our latest development . you may select which ever you need .
i think our users have the impression that your prices are always much too high , compared with those of other supplies .
excuse me . it's true that our products do cost slightly more than the other makers , but it's only due to our technological superiority .
your products may have certain advantages , but your prices are too stiff .
if you give us your inquiry , i shall go very carefully into the price and try my best to put you on the best of the terms .

yeah , it looks that way . my wife has been bugging me about it . i thought we could probably survive without one , but with a baby on the way , maybe it is time to get a car .
so this would be your first automobile ?
that's right . for quite a few years , i rode a bicycle to work . then i got a motorbike .
yeah , i think i can understand your wife's position . asking her to ride on a motorcycle when she's pregnant is a tall order .
oh ... i don't let her ride with me . it's just too dangerous . she takes the bus to work , but it is sometimes difficult to get a seat and it's crowded and hot .
so it's time to buy your very first car ! wow , that's exciting !
yes , but it's also a pretty big financial responsibility .
yeah . i still remember my first car . it was an old clunker that my dad gave me when i turned 17 . i drove it around for a couple of years until i scraped together enough money to buy a better secondhand car .
i'm having a hard time deciding which model is best for us .
yeah , it is a tough call . each one has its pros and cons . are you looking for a sedan ?

business .
yes , i can see it . but what's on it ?
it says ' keep off the grass ! '
well , there's a bench under the tree . we can sit there .
be careful . you can't smoke here .
why not ?
wait a second , pls . yes , mr . lee , we have a room reserved for you . how long do you plan to stay ?
probably two days . my wife will join me tomorrow . then we will decide when to leave for seattle .
would you sign the register , pls ?
by the way , does my room have a private bath ?
certainly , every room in this hotel has a private bath .
does my room have twin beds or a double ? i prefer a room with twin beds .
your room has twin beds , mr.lee . it also has a view . i am sure you will like it . this is your key . it's on the eighth floor room 801 . the elevator's over there .
thank you . one more thing , where is your restaurant ?
the restaurant is on the second floor . we also have a cafeteria on the top floor . if you would like something to drink , you can either call room service or come down here . the bar is right behind the lobby .

the 264 will take you there .
it goes all the way there ?
i know for a fact that it goes to the station .
what street would i catch it on ?
if you go to altadena drive , you can catch it there .
i didn't know that bus went to the gold line station .
yup , it does .
well , thanks for letting me know .
someone else is making charges on my debit card .
i need to see a statement for your debit card .
i have it right here .
can you show me which charges you ’ re referring to ?
the last four charges .
we will need to do an investigation on this .
how long will that take ?
we ’ ll have to freeze payment on those charges until the investigation is finished .
all right . now what ?
now you put the key in the ignition and start the car .
which direction should i take ?
make a left on this next street .
tell me how far to go .
keep going until i tell you to stop .
okay , but let me know ahead of time .
that's all for today , so park right there .
what about this one ?
i need five single rooms in october . how much of a discount can i get ?
our summer season ended in september . so the discount will be 40 % . that ’ s a good deal . would you prefer rooms with a front view or rear view ?
front view , please .
what date and time will you be checking in ?
october 25th around 2:00 in the afternoon .
we need you to send a deposit for 1/3 of the bill . you can send the check , or you can use the credit card .
ok . i ’ ll send a check .
could you tell me your name , address and phone number , please ?
sure . my name is anderson . my address is 109 ferguson east , holton . and my phone number is 309 789 1267 .
why not walk further to the tree over there ?
you mean at the mall ? was there a sale ?
yeah . for five minutes , everything was half off . it was total chaos ...
cool !
it's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against .
holy cow ! i never heard of such a thing . how much do they cost ?
as a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
this sounds better every second . now , when can i use the stations ?
if you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a . m . and 10 p . m .
oh , boy ! this is going to be great . i'm going to the gym right now !
well , could you let me see the room ?
ok . what about this one ?
it's fine . what beautiful scenery outside the window ! i think this one will do .
and what kind of toothbrushes would you like ?
can i have a look at them ?
sure . this brand is supposed to be very good , but they're expensive . those are new products . they come in several colors and sizes . there is also hard , soft , and medium .
are they cheaper ?
this one is 10 % off . that one has no reduction , but you can get a free tube of toothpaste with six toothbrushes .
so if i buy a dozen , i'll get two free tubes of toothpaste ?
that's right .
good . i ' ll take a dozen of them then .
and here is your aspirin . what else did you say you want ?
baby's wipes . johnson's .
anything else ?
well , actually i'd like to buy some vitamins for my son . he's five months old . can you suggest any ?
sure . here you are . this one is excellent . just mix one drop of it with milk .
what a shame ! i didn't see them .
well , can you help me look for it ? that's my first time here .
sure . it's my pleasure . i'd like to help you look for the missing keys .
it's very kind of you .
it's not a big deal.hey , i found them .
oh , thank god ! i don't know how to thank you , guys .
could you tell me how many kinds there are in your bank ?
besides the checking account , there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account .
oh , i think i'd like to take the monthly savings account then .
would you fill out this form ?
ok . here you are .
all right . and here's your deposit book .
thank you . goodbye .
i just feel a little tired . you know , it took me 16 hours to get here .
you must take a rest today .
that's very kind of you , but i can do without a rest . i have long wanted to have a talk with you about the possibility of business between us .
we welcome good business . anyhow , we know you must get tired by the flight , so we arrange a meeting tomorrow . today you can have a good rest .
thank you very much .
we hope your stay here a pleasant one !
i think so . i set it by the radio this morning .
by the way , can you tell me what the date it is today , and what day it is , please ?
well ... there is a necklace in it .
would you mind taking the necklace with you , or leaving it at the safe deposit box ?
well , don't bother . i'll take it with me . will that be all right ?
thank you , sir . here is your tag . this cloakroom is open till 11:00 p . m . , could you pick it up by then ?
okay , i see the problem . you forgot your code , didn't you ?
how did you know ?
the machine gives you three attempts to enter the correct code and after that it assumes that you are not the real owner and confiscates it .
oh . but can i have my card back now ?
time difference also makes me feel weak .
oh , i forgot about it .
it's four o'clock in the morning in chicago now , but it's time to go to bed in shanghai .
i'm not sure . perhaps around 8 pm .
fine , a reserve a table for two at 8 pm , sir , may i have your name , please ?
juliet , juliet berman .
thank you , mr.berman . and you prefer smoking or non-smoking ?
non-smoking will be fine , please . but it is more important that you get a table by the window . it's our anniversary , and i'd like to be very special .
i'll try my best . with a toward to having with this tonight , mr.berman .
thank you , goodbye .
it looks so cute . is it a parrot ?
yes . just look at her colorful feathers . what else can it be ?

really ? a foreign parrot !
he can speak english , too .
maybe you can teach lulu some english words .
look at my cell phone . i can listen to music , watch movies , take pictures , play games , surf the web and download documents . it's just like a pad .
that's cool . i can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but i'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .
that's ok . you know , digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry , and they won't cost you too much .
yeah , if i buy a cell phone like this , i don't have to take a music player everywhere i go , and i can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 .

i'll pay the money , as long as i'm getting what i pay for .

we can buy a three-liter bottle . it works out cheaper per liter . we should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .

i think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops .
