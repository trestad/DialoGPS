well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers .	essentially we have redone our insulation to keep in heat as much as possible .	i'm actually not sure , they just told me heat recovery system , i don't know what it actually does .	are you familiar with any industrial hvac systems ?	it is a very powerful heat suction device system that is placed on all our entrances and exits .
what other sources of energy do you use ?	that sounds efficient .	i've never heard of that before .	is that commonly done ?	oh , that sounds interesting .
we don't use any fossil fuels . most of our power comes from hydro - electric plants . we're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power .	we recently installed solar panels .	we have a turbine on our property .	that's all we have for right now .	we're looking into additional sources this coming year .

how ?	oh no , i didn't realize i had done so bad !	i'm shocked , that's very disappointing !	i'll just have to study and do better next time .	well , i guess i will have to try again .
there were a number of reasons .	it doesn't seem like you studied ?	you got most of the answers wrong .	you rushed through it too quickly .	you missed 22 out of 25 questions .
what were they ?	let me see the test please .	can i retake the test ?	well can you let me know what parts of the test i failed .	i will study much harder can i take it again next week .

you can take it in a couple weeks .	yes but you will have to schedule and wait for your next test .	yes but i suggest taking another 10 hours of lessons .	i would hope for the safety of others , you will never get behind the wheel again .	i just don't think you are meant to drive .
don't worry , young man . lat me give you an examination . first let me take a look at your throat . open your mouth and say'ah ' .	sounds like you have a virus .	alright , lets do some tests and see what's wrong .	open your mouth wide and say " ahh "	perhaps you have strep throat , let's see .
ah .	sure ,'ah ' .	it's very sore .	what do you thihnk i might have ?	okay , i heard strep throat is going around right now .
your throat is inflamed . and your tongue is heavily coated . you have all the symptoms of influenza .	everything looks pretty good in there .	i see your tonsils are swollen .	looks like you may have an infection in your throat .	can you open a little wider ?
what am i supposed to do then ?	can i take medicine for it ?	how long will it last	oh no ! can you check again ?	can i still go to work tomorrow ?

thank you very much .	i will rest for the entire weekend .	the medicine , can it be purchased over the counter .	the prescription is it an antibiotic .	will i be able to eat normal food .
which condiment do you use for ?	oh that sounds delicious !	i can't wait to eat . will it be ready soon ?	awww but we just had sour - peppery soup yesterday .	i was hoping you'd say that !
i'll use ginger , garlic scallion , hot pepper and vinegar .	with the red carp and rape with mushrooms .	the sour - peppery soup we have baked garlic bread .	we also have buttery garlic butter for the carp .	the sour - peppery soup you can also have saltine crackers .
very good , need i help you ?	i don't like ginger .	i might skip the soup .	i've never had carp .	you've been busy .
no , don't need , i can do myself .	no , thank you .	i think i can manage on my own .	i don't need help yet but i'll let you know if that changes .	i think i'll be okay without your help but thank you .
thanks . i can watch tv now .	okay , just let me know if you change your mind .	okay , just call me if you think of anything for me to do .	okay , i'm just going to get washed up .	thanks so much , just let me know when it is ready .

i can't really deal with any distractions right now , but i appreciate the nice evening we spent together .	i'm really busy trying to get packed , i don't think i can make the time .	i could probably meet for a quick coffee this week .	i'm moving back home on the weekend , i don't think i will have time to squeeze a coffee in .	i could probably free up an hour for coffee on saturday morning .
ok , that shall be arranged .	we can easily do that for you .	i'm sorry but someone has reserved the room for the 28th . i can offer you a different room ?	i can extend your stay time but it may cost more since it is going into the holiday .	i can give you a different double room for the 28th at a discounted price .

i have no problem with that .	that's a bit high . do you have anything less expensive ?	that's more than i was wanting to pay .	surely , you can find a better deal than that .	that is out of the price range i was thinking of .
great ! would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking ?	okay , and how many people will be staying ?	okay , would you prefer a lake or ocean view for this visit ?	great . i'll be happy to help book those for you then .	are we celebrating anything special on this trip ?

i apologize , but i didn't realize that i did .	i did not notice that it was red .	i thought it was still green when i went through it .	i did not know it was red .	i am sorry officer , i thought it was still green .
weren't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ?	i'm going to write you a ticket	i'll just give you a warning	have you been drinking ?	do you use prescription drugs ?
i did learn that .	i understand but i did not realize that i was driving through the yellow light	i am aware of that but i didn't know that i was moving that fast	i thought i was driving at the stated speed limit	it didn't seem as if i was speeding , officer
so , then why did you speed up ?	do you drive through here often ?	where do you live ?	where are you going ?	try to be more careful .
i don't know what to tell you .	i'm sorry , i was running late to work .	i have a family emergency and was trying to get there fast .	unfortunately i'm running out of gas so i was trying to make it to that gas station before i ran out .	i didn't realize i sped up . my apologies .
i'm going to have to write you a ticket .	can i see you license and registration , please ?	i'm afraid i'm going to have to write you up .	well , that's the law . i have to give you a ticket .	these are rules to keep drivers safe .

is that really all that you eat ?	it's hard to eat well because there is so much conflicting evidence about what is healthy or not	i think everything is fine in moderation	that sounds healthy . i wish i could do the same	do you have eat starchy carbs ?
that's basically it .	i slip with junk food occasionally , but not often .	i try to be pretty disciplined with my diet , but i don't always succeed .	no , of course i eat some crappy food too .	i wish ! i'd be healthier if that was all i ate .
how do you stick to only those foods ?	don't you get bored eating the same things ?	you might like salmon . i have a great recipe you should try .	what do you usually eat for breakfast ?	that's already pretty healthy . sounds like you're doing great .
actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you .	i have good self - discipline .	i avoid unhealthy foods at all costs .	i enjoy eating those foods the most .	it's hard , but i make it work .
yeah , i know , but what about the chicken ?	i know that but they are gross .	yea but don't you want junk food some times .	i like fruits and veggies i just can't eat them all the time .	i will try to add them in more of my meals .
i mainly eat baked chicken , because there's not a lot of fat .	chicken is very good for you if it's baked .	chicken has a lot of protein .	baked chicken can help you lose weight .	it's a good source of protein and delicious .
that does sound pretty good .	do you have any good recipes ?	i just get bored of chicken , i need to spice it up .	what about fish ?	no red meat ?
i know it does , and that's because it is .	yes , it is very good and pretty healthy .	it is good , you should come over and i will make you dinner .	thanks , it's been a struggle , but i am starting to see results .	i appreciate your kind words , i am getting used to eating more healthy .

would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ?	what did you do at the insurance company as a secretary ?	what was it like being a secretary at an insurance company ?	why does an insurance company need a secretary ?	how did you like that job ?
well , to begin with , i would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average .	a positive attitude .	perception for tasks that need to be completed .	friendly to others .	good typing skills .
have you had any experience with computer ?	do most secretaries have these qualities ?	how can one be diligent ?	do you take notes on a tablet or computer ?	do you have memory tricks you've learned ?
yes , i studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer .	yes , quite a lot actually . i've been using computers since i was young	i began using computers in primary school	i use computers in my daily life both at work and home	i enjoy using computers
that's fine . what about operating the fax and duplicator ?	that's good to know	that would be really helpful .	you seem like a great fit for us .	computer skills are vital in the current economy .
i can handle them without any trouble	i am very familiar with the fax and duplicator .	i have had lots of experience with both .	i don't think i will have any problems with them .	of course , i use them all the time .
what have you learned from jobs you have held ?	that sounds perfect , now do you have any supervisory experience in your past work history ?	wonderful , how much experience do you have working with excel documents ?	that sounds good , though do you know your way around word processor shortcuts ?	great , are you comfortable with using customer relations management software ?
above all , i have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . so i follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed .	i've had tons of experience in this area .	i know how to handle many types of situations .	i am more confident in myself .	i've learned to be more organized .
very good .	good to hear . can you give me some references i can contact ?	i like that . when can you start ?	are you available to start work next week ?	what kind of salary would you like ?
how come ? last time i saw you . you told me it was a good job , and you'd like to take it as a career . that was only one month ago . why this sudden change ?	that is too bad	are you looking for a new job	that is terrible . what can i do to help you with that ?	i will try to get you a new job as soon as possible
it's a long story . in a word , i didn't do a good job of it . i messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and i messed it up .	new management came in and overhauled everything .	i was sick and couldn't go in for several days , they fired me because of my absences .	they wanted someone more qualified for the job .	i got into an argument with my boss and he let me go .
what are you going to do now ?	was all the blame placed on you ?	did you see warning signs that something was off ?	did you try to explain yourself ?	what are you going to do now ?
i am trying to find a job asap . lily doesn't know yet . i didn't tell her . i spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought i went to work as usual .	i guess i need to look for another job	i've been working on my resume	i have put my resume on a few job sites	do you know anywhere that is hiring ?
that's not the way to solve the problem . did you look in the classified advertisements column ?	when are you going to tell her ?	she is going to find out sooner or later .	how did you mess up the business deal ?	is lily going to be mad at you ?
yes , i did . but i wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in .	to be honest , i have been so frazzled that i don't know what to do .	i started looking this morning . do you know of any openings ?	i have looked some online , but haven't found anything yet .	i need to get moving and find a job , thanks for the advise .
listen . i will see what i can do , ok ? you go home and tell lily about this problem you have now . she is your wife and i am sure she will understand .	the key to finding a new job is networking usually . do you know anyone you could ask ?	maybe get in touch with a recruiter ? i've heard some people have had success with that .	i think you should tell lily . she may have some ideas .	did you check your social networks ? don't be afraid to ask around . don't be ashamed
i just don't know how to bring it up . well , all right . she has the right to know anyways .	so you can't help me any more ?	i'm depressed , i don't know what to do .	she can't help me .	she doesn't understand .
i parked in the red zone .	parking in a handicap space .	parking in a fire zone .	my meter expired .	double parking .
why did you do that ?	was it clearly marked ?	i thought they didn't really enforce stuff like that ?	how much was the ticket ?	you might as well just pay it .
i needed to get something really quick .	i was running late for class .	i thought i was only going to be in the store for a minute but i got hung up longer than anticipated	i had to run in and grab something really quick	i did nt realize that it was illegal
where did you park at ?	you are going to get a ticket .	you just might get towed .	be quick about it before the tow truck comes .	how long are you going to take ?
at my apartment building .	it was in front of a fire hydrant .	i parked in a loading zone .	i parked in a bus lane .	i parked in a no parking zone .
don't you have your own parking spot ?	well that was foolish . you should never risk something like that .	oh no . do you need help paying the ticket ?	do you think you can contest it ?	i'm sorry to here that . that happened to me once but i got it waived .
i needed to be fast .	no i don't .	someone parked in my spot .	i forgot where my parking spot was	someone complained that it wasn't mine .
that was very lazy of you .	well maybe next time you should be more careful .	that's a shame , how much was the ticket ?	are you going to fight the ticket ?	have you gotten a lot of tickets ?
do you have the statement for your card ?	i m sorry to hear that	let me look into that for you	what were the dates / times of the charges and the amounts	let me ask you a few security questions .
here it is .	yes i do actually .	give me a minute while i find it .	yes , let me pull it up now .	it's right in front of me .
what are the charges you're referring to ?	let me log into my computer and i would be happy to help you .	don't worry , we will get this straightened out .	thank you , let me see how i can help you .	we will get this figured out , i am here to help you .
the last four charges on the page .	there's one for an online purchase , and another for a furniture store .	i'm seeing a charge for a best buy in - store order , and another purchase at a cvs .	there are two i didn't make , one at office depot and another from nordstrom .	i see a purchase from macy's and another from h&m , both of which i haven't been to recently .
i'm afraid we're going to have to investigate these charges .	can you go over these charges ?	can you be more specific ?	i need more information on these charges .	go over these charges with me .
how long will an investigation take ?	how long is that going to take ?	how long before i get my money back ?	what if your investigation comes up with nothing ?	i guess that's better than nothing .
i honestly don't know , but we will freeze payment on these charges .	it usually is resolved within 7 business days .	it could take anywhere from 2 days to 2 weeks .	it really depends on difficult it is to track the charges .	it usually doesn't take too long , maybe a few days or so .
that sounds absolutely fantastic .	will you be able to tell me more about the finding of your investigation ?	can this card be canceled ?	thank you , is there anything else you need from me ?	can i call back anytime to check in on the investigation ?
ok , could i take a look at some i d please , like a passport ?	very good , i'll get that taken care of for you right away .	sounds perfect , i'll make the transaction .	ok , two years it is , one moment please .	no problem , i'll have that for you in a moment .
here you go . by the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ?	yes , here is my passport .	will my driver's license work ?	i always carry my passport with me .	my passport is in my car .
no , i'm afraid that isn't possible . you must wait until maturity before you cash them .	yes , as long as you bring your i d at that time .	no , i'm sorry . you'll have to wait until it matures .	if you cash them prior to maturity you will be subject to a fee .	i will have to check with my manger .
i had a skydiving accident over the weekend and won't be able to come to school today .	i would like to do some extra credit .	what do you have that i can do ?	how is my grade looking ?	how much will the extra credit help ?
my goodness ! are you ok ?	are you all right ?	i'm sorry to hear it . thanks for letting me know .	oh no , that's terrible . are you all right ?	i'm sorry to hear . of course you're excused from class . thanks for letting me know .
i broke my leg , but it is healing .	i'm actually going to have to stay off of my feet for a few weeks while my ankles heal .	i'm ok , but i hurt one of my legs and i need stay off of it for a while .	i actually broke both of my legs when i had a mishap trying to land .	i'm fine however , i need to stay off of my feet for a few days until my sprained ankle heals .
how long will you be out of class ?	ok well your assignments are online so you should be able to keep up .	how long do you think you'll be out .	ok well i hope to see you in class next week . we have some exciting material that i think you'd enjoy learning about .	will you be able to come in later this week ? or atleast let me know and i'll make arrangements for you to get your work .
i should be able to return by next monday .	the doctor isn't sure yet . i'll have to let you know when i find out .	the doctor says i should be moving around again in about a week with the help of crutches .	i should be able to return to class next week if everything goes as planned .	hopefully , i'll be able to come back next week .
fine . well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . i hope you feel better soon .	that should be no problem then .	you can look on my website for assignments .	i hope you get well soon .	that's not too bad , then .
yeah , i have a little one myself . anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . i would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn't shutting off properly . i could have it all finished by today if it's urgent .	it looks like there is a barie doll stuck in there .	i will need to get a special too .	this will take i while .	i will need to shut off your water .
that would be great ! is it expensive ?	that would be wonderful !	could you tell me about how much it will cost ?	the toilet is rather urgent , but the faucet could wait until a later time .	if you could at least get the toilet fixed today i would appreciate it very much .
let's see . . . i would say about eight hundred dollars .	it could be depending on how many of the pipes need to be replaced .	it won't run more than the cost of a days worth of labor and the cost of the replacement parts .	it could run anywhere between $ 500 and $ 2 ,500 for the repairs depending on how damaged the pipes are .	it won't be more than $ 600 , and i will get started right away .
ok . here you are .	i'll get that right away for you .	i'll bring that over in just a moment .	what size ?	coming right up !
could i have some fruit ?	thank you .	thanks .	sounds good .	okay then .
of course . wait for a moment , please .	what kind of fruit would you like ?	we only have grapes and strawberries .	we are out of fruit at the moment .	we haven't gotten our produce delivery for the day .
how are you getting along with your business ?	did you go to any good restaurants ?	was the weather good in new york ?	was you flight okay ?	are you tired from your trip ?
not bad . the fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year .	it is going pretty smoothly thanks !	it has ups and downs but so far so good .	it's going really good , thanks for asking .	i'm loving it so far .
i hope we can do more business together . though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . in the meantime , let's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance .	certainly there will be more buyers .	i certainly hope so .	yes , it won't be long now .	it should pick up soon .
it is a good idea . what dish are you cooking now ? !	what do you like to cook ?	how long have you been cooking ?	what is your best dish ?	what got you interested in cooking ?
i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . have you ever tried steamed fish ?	i am making pakoras	just a simple soup	a big chicken for me to enjoy for a few days . would you like some ?	a traditional soup from my homeland
yes , i have . but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . the fish is not well - done and too salty .	no , i've never had steamed fish ! sounds good .	yes , my mother used to make it for me .	i believe that i have tried it on a restaurant a few years ago .	no , i have no . i am allergic to fish .
that's the case . i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much .	have you tried the fish anywhere else ?	maybe next time you can ask them to be light on the salt .	that's a shame . i really like the fish there .	maybe you could try the fried fish next time .
i have the same idea as yours .	have you ever tried seasoning it with ginger and garlic ?	if you serve it with something bland , like rice , it will balance the soy sauce taste .	i had fish cooked with lemongrass once . it's a delicate flavor .	maybe that's because the fish has a delicate taste . you should try a strong - flavored fish next time .
it's ok . please have a taste of it .	let's figure out how to improve it .	i don't think this one will be too salty .	i will use less salt and soy sauce .	i'm glad you are here helping me .
thank you . oh , it's very delicious .	much better than a restaurant's !	sorry , but this is not for me .	i think it needs more soy sauce .	it actually needs more salt .
thank you for your praise .	wow , i am so thrilled that you like it !	i got this recipe from my aunt in italy . it is so easy to prepare .	it is a really versatile way to cook fish . you can add different side dishes to make it even fancier .	you just stay for dinner as i made a lot of fish .
besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ?	you are an excellent cook !	you'll have to give me the recipe .	what kind of fish are you cooking with ?	you're welcome . you're an excellent chef .
i am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc .	i am also good at cooking steak ! would you like some ?	i really enjoy cooking dishes involving chicken .	i can cook any type of fish ! it's my go to cooking .	i'm really good at making casseroles . would you like me to make you one ?
so many dishes . next friday week is my birthday . i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , ok ?	it all sounds delicious !	you seem to know a lot of dishes !	how to you season your fried chicken ?	are you gon na make beef and potato stew anytime soon ?
why not ? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking .	i'm not sure i can do that .	oh , thanks for asking .	how many people are coming ?	what kind of dishes would you be interested in ?
thanks a lot .	would love to try your cooking !	thanks for helping out .	how long have you been cooking ?	what are you planning to make then ?
it's my pleasure .	i would be honored to cook for you .	what would you like me to cook ?	would pasta be okay ?	you're very welcome .
sir , we are terribly sorry for that . we will refund the charge and send your laundry to your room 3 hours later . is that all right ?	great , i will go check on your order .	i will get it to you as soon as we finish it .	it should take about 30 minutes .	should i put that on your tab ?
that's fine .	yes , that is fine	that will be okay . thank you	yes thank you for your help	that is perfect .
ok .	all right , i am happy to help !	could you push the gas door unlock button .	it will only take a few minutes .	no problem !
a bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due .	that sounds very fair .	that works for me .	do you have a list of acceptable banks .	i will get right on it .
then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible .	we can't continue until we know the bank is acceptable to us .	i am sure , but our protocols demand the bank be acceptable to us .	no other issues have dampened the cost of imports with our other customers . please check your bank again and get back to us .	i'm sorry . there is no other way .
i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries .	you have nothing to worry about .	you have my word it will be honored .	let's compromise in the middle .	what bank do you want to use ?
so do i .	i believe our mutual interests will in deed help forge a strong business relation between our countries .	it has been a pleasure working with you and your embassy .	my lawyer will provide the contract and the details of the draft .	i am glad we were able to seal the deal , and i believe it will bring prosperity to both our countries .

well , you'll just have to wait . i'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . don't worry . you'll get to the hospital in time .	that is true ; i best go ahead and drive you there .	let's call and maybe we can get an idea how long it will take for the police to get here , okay ?	i really don't think your injuries are that bad . if we don't make a police report you may have to pay for the damages even though it wasn't your fault .	well , where exactly do you hurt ? are you bleeding ? let me look .
it really hurts .	sorry , but i don't think that's a good idea .	if you're going to do that , i'm just going to hail a cab instead .	that doesn't sound like a good plan . i need to get there now .	i'm bleeding all over this car ; i don't want to wait any longer .
yes , maybe it does . but if you're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ?	elevate the wound .	put compression on it .	make yourself comfortable .	take deep breaths .
to hell with you . the accident was your fault .	i guess , but i don't like it .	no , please explain it some more in further detail .	sure , whatever you say .	i do , but you could be a little more understanding .
i'm afraid it wasn't . and when the police get here , you will also see that it wasn't . but enough of this bickering . i'm going to go find a phone . don't move that arm while i'm gone . alright ?	you really need to calm down , sir .	everything will be okay when the police get here .	to hell with you !	this was not my fault .
to hell with you .	its so nice of you to worry about protecting yourself instead of worrying about what you did to me .	just admit you're wrong okay ?	you're talking a big game now , but when the police show that you're wrong , then what ?	you're not being very helpful , you know ?
sure . it's to raise money for the homeless .	the performance is for a charity to raise funds for our local animal shelter .	it will be at 7 p .m . but you might want to get here a bit early to take advantage of our free parking lot . if not you may have to pay for parking elsewhere .	the saturday performance is a very traditional popular opera but with some local adaptations to it ; i have heard it is quite enjoyable and enlightening .	it costs 35 dollars and i would suggest buying a ticket as soon as possible .
what about the performance itself ?	what charity is it through ?	who is performing at this performance ?	how much money will go toward the homeless ?	how long will it last ?
oh , it's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven .	i love helping people .	i love to do good deeds .	i like to give back .	it makes me feel important .

it surely is . and the cast is really the best .	yes , it's a favorite of mine .	it's the one i'm most looking forward to .	i'm most excited about this one .	i will be there myself .
wonderful ! how much is the ticket ?	i look forward to attending .	can you help me buy tickets ?	what time does the performance end ?	who is in the lead role ?
the price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back .	only 80 so it's not too bad .	you can get two for 150 .	80 , but you get really good seats .	80 , but you're helping out a great cause .
perhaps one year , i'm not sure .	i'd like it done in two weeks .	we are not on a tight deadline .	how long will it take you to get it done ?	write me a proposal and include your timeline .
sorry , it's not available now . anything else ?	sorry , i didn't hear you at first . french dressing it is .	ok , understood . coming right up !	sorry . . . french dressing it is .	i couldn't hear over the noise here . salad with french dressing coming up .

thank you .	thank you .	can i pay by credit card ?	how much do i owe .	thanks for the great service .
i'll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .	that is great advice thank you	i did not even think of that , i appreciate it	that is so true and important i appreciate you taking the time to help me	i already know the area a bit thankfully
that's right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes .	i believe that you'll do a good job .	make sure you give the interviewer a strong handshake too .	remember to speak clearly and professionally .	what are you planning on wearing ?
it's always easier to say something than to do it .	that is all good advice . do you have any more suggestions ?	yes , a good image is important . what are some other ways to make a good image for myself to be sure that i make a good impression ?	do you have any more tips to help me make a good impression for the interviewer ?	thank you that is really good advice . i'll be sure to follow it .
it's not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well - groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications .	that s not always the case .	good luck with the interview .	try to practice the interview to give you some confidence .	also , make sure you get enough sleep .
but i love wearing t - shirts and jeans .	that is great advice . thank you .	thanks , george . i really appreciate it .	i will do my best to make you proud .	thanks . i know all of this , it's just good to hear it out loud .
i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes .	you may want to consider something a little more classy to make a good impression .	dressing a little more business like makes a good impression and will help you stand out to your potential employers .	i'm not saying you can't wear your t - shirts and jeans , but you may want to take a classier approach for a job interview .	it might be a good idea to dress up a little bit and ask the employer about dress code during the interview . it's definitely better to be safe than sorry in a situation like that .
it's a pity that i can not afford more expensive clothes .	i see	you make some good points	understood	i'll take that into consideration
you misunderstood me . clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous .	it is best to just be yourself . don't brag but don't downplay your abilities either !	make sure you dress nice without being overly dressed . you might want to ask someone at the company ahead of time what guidelines they have for interviews .	first impressions are everything . try not to be too nervous and do your best to express yourself and only focus on your strengths !	just go with how you feel in the moment . you can spend days preparing and then blow it if you aren't feeling it when you walk in . it is best to stay stress and worry free and feel things out when you arrive .
i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time .	what would you advise me to wear ?	do you think a pair of slacks and button down shirt would be appropriate ?	i'll go to the jobsite later today to see what the other employees wear .	any other things i should be aware of ?
you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .	you have to dress for the job you want .	no one will take you seriously if you don't dress appropriately .	you can start to adjust your style once you get the job and see what everyone else is wearing .	don't be overdressed though . if the office is business casual don't come in a tux .
it seems that'clothes make the man ' .	you are so right .	i know , but i wish i could get an expensive suit just so i can have it for more interviews	that's true . thanks for the advice	i understand . thank you .
it may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior .	you got it .	yes they do .	that's a good way of putting it .	yes . don't worry , you'll do fine .

good , i hope you'll make sure that it won't happen again .	how will you fix them ?	when will you fix them ?	that is a vague response	i do not appreciate this lack of customer service
i'll certainly look into that .	we will try our best .	absolutely , i have also offered you a discount on your next order .	of course , customer service is our number 1 priority .	we have fired the man responsible .
thank you . goodbye .	when can i expect replacements ?	what if i want a refund ?	can you take care of it today ?	how are you going to take care of it exactly ?
is there a price reduction ?	that sounds a little steep .	they are very pretty .	that is right at the amount i am willing to pay .	it's my wife . i can pay a lot more than that .
we are having a sale now . the price has already gone down .	these aren't on sale at the moment .	i'm sorry , sir , these aren't discounted at the moment .	no , sir , perhaps you could let me know your budget so i would have a better idea of what may best fit your needs ?	these aren't on special at the moment , sir .
how much is that one ?	can i get a discount on top of that ?	how much has the price gone down ?	will the price go down again ?	how long does the sale last ?
it's two hundred and eighty dollars .	it is now $ 300 .	it doesn	it doesn't matter , i wouldn't recommend this one .	it costs $ 250 but the sale ends today .
ok . i'll take it . thank you .	can you show me another one ?	how much is it regularly ?	how long is it ?	do you think my wife will like it ?
alright . there are several models you may want to look at . this kreng portable cassette player is very good .	ok , and of the many colors available do you have a specific color you like ?	great ! let me look up what models we have that will work for you .	what features would you like on your walkman ?	are there any specific brands you are looking at ?
kreng ? i've never heard of that company .	does that have a radio as well ?	is there another option you would recommend ?	what price range is that model in ?	does it include headphones ?
it's a german company . this unit has auto - reverse , recording capability , and an am / fm radio band . it also has a built - in microphone .	they have a very good reputation .	we have another brand of similar price .	nobody has ever returned with a complaint after purchasing one of their products .	do you have a problem trying out a new brand ?
i suppose i don't want that one then . i don't like auto - reverse . it breaks too easily .	what else can it do ?	when was this produced ?	where in germany is it located ?	is the company profitable ?
really ? have you had an auto - reverse break before ?	most of the units have auto reverse now .	we have other models to choose from .	do you have a favorite brand ?	what do you think of sony ?
yes , twice now . i think it's too high - tech , and so it's the first part that breaks .	i have and it was very frustrating .	i have read many reviews about the auto - reverse breaking .	the auto - reverse just isn't a feature that i want .	can you please try to find me a model without the auto - reverse feature ?
hmm . you know , the problem might be dust . did you clean the unit often ?	so , i guess i will not take on with auto - reverse .	i have never had auto - reverse break on me .	i'm glad that you told me that .	is there any other things i should be worried about ?
well . no , i didn't clean it . but still , i only had the last one two months , and it broke . i don't trust auto - reverse .	i should have thought of that	i haven't , is that what might be the problem ?	i have cleaned it	i have cleaned it
alright . well . we have many units without auto - reverse . here is a good unit . very reliable . it has an am / fm band , built - in microphone , recording capability , and no auto - reverse .	let me show you some other models without auto - reverse .	i could show you a good way to properly clean out the device .	samsung is another popular company that makes cassette tape players without auto - reverse .	can you tell me the other brands you have used ? that way we can find you a different one .
how much is it ?	does it have a warranty ?	what are the customer approval ratings ?	do you sell a cleaning kit for it ?	have you used this one yourself ?
this one sells for $ 39 . 99 .	depends , how much you got ?	before we got into price , will you be financing or using cash or credit ?	without the auto - reverse , about $ 35	are you trading in your old device ? if so , it will be much cheaper .
can i test it out ?	what is the brand name of the unit ?	do you have a customer review rating for that option ?	how long have you carried that product ?	i may be interested in that one , does it come in black ?
of course .	yes please feel free to try it for yourself .	absolutely , i encourage that !	no problem , and let me know if you have any additional questions .	unfortunately we don't have any demo units available .

are you interested in a full - time or part - time position ?	what are your skills ?	what can you do for our company ?	can you make our company better ?	are you good at writing ?
i am more interested in a full - time position . however , i would also consider a part - time position .	definitely full time .	part time for now , but maybe more in the future .	i'm not sure , what is available ?	full time , depending on scheduling .
can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ?	are you available to work late nights if needed ?	what are your salary requirements ?	what do you expect to get out of a career here ?	what are your long term goals with our company ?
i advised customers on financial matters . after i consulted the customer , i completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . i then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . the clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that i formulated on a quarterly basis .	i prepared financial documents .	i worked closely with clients to improve their financials	i brought new clients to the firm .	i went over day to day operations of the firms numbers .
what is your greatest strength ?	do you think your family could adjust to life here ?	do you have school - age children because we have a great school system .	how long have you been in this country ?	where do you see yourself in 5 years ?
i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together .	i am excellent at understanding a customers need .	i work very well with groups of people on projects and other large tasks .	i am very quick when it comes to getting my work completed and ready for clients .	i enjoy working with other people .
what is your greatest weakness ?	great , you got the job	i m sorry but your overqualified for this position	i think you would be more suited for a different department .	but can you play fortnite ?
i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however , i began setting time - limits for myself .	my greatness weakness is that i often care too much what people think . for example , if someone criticizes me to harshly i will take offense .	i tend to take my work home with me which can often make it difficult for me to unwind and relax .	my greatness weakness is definitely in regards to just working too hard . i care so much about my job that i often work myself into the ground at times because i want to succeed that badly !	my greatness weakness is not knowing when to quit . i care so much about everything and i ensure that i put 100 % effort into everything i do . i do not like failure but sometimes something isn't possible to accomplish yet i will still try .
why do you want to work for our company ?	what types of hobbies do you have ?	where do you picture yourself career wise in 5 years ?	can you give me an example of one time you had an issue with a customer or co - worker and how you handled the situation ?	are you interested in continuing your education if offered through he company ?
after following your firm's progress for the last 3 years , i am convinced that your company is becoming one of the market leaders and i would like to be a part of that team .	i have been using your software for years and i'm convinced it's the best on the market . i would take great pride in working here .	i noticed the company gives back quite a bit to the community and this is in line with my general life philosophy .	i've read your company's mission and vision for the future . it is exactly in line with my career goals .	your company has been at the forefront of innovation . i'm looking for a company that is constantly growing and innovating .

immediately .	i can begin right away .	i am ready to get started at any time .	i am eager to get started as soon as i can .	when do you need me ?
it is just too dark in here with so few windows .	i think it needs more than that !	look at how dated everything in the kitchen is .	a major remodel is needed for this .	i'd rather look at another house .
i hear that the kitchen is quite large . let's go check it out .	i think that adding some additional lighting may brighten things up s bit .	maybe we can add a window to let in more natural light .	i think that the lighting is sufficient considering the size of the house .	i think that painting the walls in a bright color might make the place seem a little bit brighter .
the kitchen may be large , but it doesn't have any storage space .	i do not think the house is worth it .	the kitchen can not make up for the rest of the house .	the house needs way more than the a new kitchen	why do you think a kitchen would change my mind .
the master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . maybe it will be a little better .	what about the basement ?	is there space for a garden ?	is the garage big enough for two cars .	let remodel it and make it bigger then .
how many dogs live in this house ?	the closets are way to small .	the bathroom has a very small mirror .	the lighting in here is really bad .	there is only one window in the master suite .
i think that we have seen all that we need to see here . let's go look at another house .	no dogs live here at the moment which is why it is so clean .	there are several dogs living here but they are all well behaved .	not many , do you like dogs ?	no dogs live here but there are cats .
that's great , bring me a bottle of that please .	ok , i will take the white wine .	is that your best recommendation ?	i already have a good appetite .	does it go well with my meal ?
oops , cancel that . change the second call to 7 thirty will you , please ?	great !	thank you . good night !	that sounds great thanks !	perfect , thanks !
no sooner said than done . can i help you with anything else ?	7 thirty . i have it changed .	we'll call you at 7 thirty then .	not a problem . 7 thirty , not 7 fifteen .	ok . 7 and 7 thirty .
no , that's about it for now . thanks .	no , i'm all set .	nope , that's all i need .	any chance i can have coffee sent up after the second call ?	if i don't answer either call , can you add a third one for 7:40 ?

don't worry . you can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass . the bus stop is right there .	can you check google map for me for the direction ?	i'm afraid it will take us 20 minutes more to go to beijing hotel .	just sit and relax . i'll take you there for sure !	go to the next intersection and take a u - turn . then follow the main road until you see big avenue and you turn right . beijing hotel will be on your right .
thank you very much .	oh ok ! thanks !	and the bus will take me to the hotel ?	will that be the bus stop i need to go the hotel ?	ok , so , i just do that and then i can get to the hotel on the bus , right ?
my pleasure .	you're welcome !	no problem , have fun !	sure thing .	i hope you enjoy it !

do you have any work experience in promotion ?	that's great . what else can you tell me about why you want to pursue this ?	how did you get interested in this field ?	where did you go to college ?	tell me more about what you did for your graduation field work ?
yes , i do . i have worked as a salesman for p & g company ltd .	yes , i have 2 years of experience with promotion .	no , but i am willing to learn !	yes , i work with promotion at my last job quite often .	yes , i am proficient in promotion and have used it extensively .
do people respond well to you ?	what was your average sales amount in that job ?	can you tell me more about that ?	was that a good company to work for ?	why did you leave that company ?

yes , of course . excuse me . could you possibly let us see your menu ? oh . they haven't got one either .	no , i think that would be rude .	how about i find a host or hostess and ask for a menu from them ?	we could wait for a waiter to come and bring us a menu .	let's sit and enjoy the view out the window for a few minutes and wait .
your discount is already included . normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . this is our sale period .	normally bicycle initial rate start from 350 range	this bicycle having many good qualities	this not expensive . this is fair amount to buy bicycle	this bicycle having place detector
it's still too much . can't you make it any cheaper than that ?	i can't but i can show you a different one .	sure let me see what i can do for you .	how much are you looking to spend ?	that is our price and we can not go lower .
sorry , but this is the best price . you can't get it any cheaper than here .	i'm not allowed to do that .	i can not do this at this time . i can escalate you to a supervisor .	let me see what i can do .	i'm sorry , i can not .
i see . can i pay by traveler's checks ?	what makes the bike so expensive , then ?	so talk me through this . explain to me how it's worth so much money .	what sort of a bike do you ride ?	are you certain about that ?
i'm afraid you can't . you're welcome to pay in cash .	unfortunately , no . we can take personal checks , credit cards or cash .	no , our policy does not allow for traveler's checks .	sorry , we only accept cash or credit .	excuse me while i check our company policy .
i didn't know i needed change .	where can i get some quaters ?	how many quarters ?	i don't have any quarters .	i will pay after you show me how .
the washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar .	look and see if the machine has a coin slot for quarters .	see if there is an attendant that can give you change .	do you see a sign anywhere that states how much it costs to use the wash machine ?	yes , and you'll need quarters for the dryer too .
where do i put the change ?	i don't have any change .	does this place have a change machine ?	can you spot me some quarters ?	i see . thank you .
the quarters go into the slot . you have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on .	you see the tray on the very top ?	look above the digital display .	it's turned sideways , way up on top .	there's a slide tray on top . put the coins in , then shove the tray in hard .
is that everything that i have to do ?	do i need to select my wash options before pushing the slot in ?	if i stop the machine during the cycle do i need to enter more money ?	does the washer lock once i put the slot in or will i be able to get into the load during the cycle ?	that makes sense ! thank you for being patient with me .
that's all there is .	you also have to make sure that you put your detergent in the washer and press start .	there are different options for washing such as heavy loads , delicate loads , and different washing temperatures . make sure you select the option that is right for your clothes .	yes , that is all that you need to do .	when using the drier , make sure you clean out the lint trap and put in your drier sheets before pressing start .
i appreciate you helping me with this .	are you sure ?	okay excellent it is working now .	i appreciate all your help .	its still not working what should i do ?
if you need anything else , just let me know .	no problem at all .	of course , that is what i am here for .	do you need assistance with anything else right now .	do you need to locate a change machine ?
that's the company policy .	that is what the company allows .	i don't make the rules .	yes , only three days .	you get more when you've worked a larger number of years .
what happens if i use up my sick days before the end of the year ? if i'm sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ?	did the company happen to consult with any psychologists before coming up with this policy ?	where did this policy come from ?	am i not expected to have a life ?	does that policy work for you ?
yes . that's the company policy .	if you use extra sick days then we will deduct vacation days first .	if you have vacation days we will take the sick days out of those . after that we will deduct pay .	if you have used all of your sick days and vacation days we will deduct pay .	yes , but only if you do not have any vacation days left .
it was the same as the last place i worked at . i was hoping you'd be different .	how many sick days do i get ?	do sick days take away from my vacation time ?	are the vacation days paid or unpaid ?	is there anything else i should know about the company policy ?
i don't think i ever got food from the cafeteria .	ugh , really ? i was thinking something more ambitious .	i guess it is cheap , at least . in more ways than one .	am i even allowed in there ?	why the cafeteria ?
i actually like the food there .	really ? it is actually quite good .	i've been there several times and have always enjoyed the food .	it's good ! they have a variety of options and i'm sure you'll find something you'll enjoy .	let's go there today . it's close , quick , and pretty good .
does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ?	what type of food do they typically serve ?	okay , well i trust your opinion . let's go there !	do they have vegan options ?	i will try their food . what time do you want to meet there ?
they have anything you want .	yeah it actually has a wide selection .	not really but i still like it .	just depends on what you conside a lot .	yeah it has so much to pick from . you'll be surprised .
i was thinking about getting some chinese food .	okay . i guess that i will give it a try .	okay . maybe i will get a salad .	how about we go across the street to chipotle ?	can they make a fresh sandwich ?
i bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . it tasted great .	there's a good chinese place just down the road .	i'd be fine with that .	they actually have chinese options in the cafeteria .	okay , do you have anyplace specific in mind ?
we can eat at the cafeteria .	lets get some !	alright , i trust your judgement	not in the mood for chow mein	is there anything else there ?
i think you'll really like the food there .	all right ! let's go !	okay . i recommend their egg rolls , too .	you won't be disappointed !	what sort of chinese food are you hungry for today ?
thank you .	thank you . is there anything that you would like to discuss ?	thank you . can you think of anything else that should be included in the contract ?	thank you . do you have any proposed additions to the contract ?	thank you . can you think of anything else that should be included to prevent confusion down the road ?
well , i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time .	can you hand me a pen ?	i'm ready to sign it .	i'd like to get two copies to take with me , please .	so let's go ahead and finish this up then .
that's a good idea .	what are you opinions ?	do you have differing opinions ?	are there any concerns ?	i would like to share my concerns
first , let's read clause two about packing . it's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . that'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . so , we'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract .	which point would you like to address first ?	do you have any questions before we begin ?	first , i'd like to defend my stance on the clause i feel is most important to this contract .	are you ready ?
agreed .	that would be fine with me	i will check with my boss to see if that is ok	we may not be able to do that	what type of containers ?
for shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it won't all be finished at one time . so would you allow us to make partial shipments .	i will agree	its really good	very good	read about packing
i understand your position .	i am okay with partial shipments .	let me ask my partner what he thinks .	how far apart do you expext the partial shipments to be ?	yes , i can agree to that .
that looks great . do you have ties here ?	what's the price of that one ?	do you have any with a pinstripe ?	how many buttons are on the jacket ?	what are the materials in that one ?
i should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . do you have any suggestion in mind ? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable .	is there a price you would like to propose ?	do you have a price range ?	is the price too high or low ?	what price are you looking at ?
that's why i came to your office today . we think for your model we - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579 - 649 .	well , anything over $ 5 ,000 is over our budget .	would you possibly consider knocking a thousand off ?	do you offer a lower - cost model of the same air conditioner brand ?	yes , and we're excited to learn negotiation is an option !
that's true . but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount .	where have you seen those prices ?	we may be able to do that	our original price is very fair	ok lets agree on that
i see your point . that's to say s 611 each set . still it's much higher than the market price . could you see your way to reduce the price , jack ?	i will agree	its really good	very good	its true
well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . that's the best we can do . what do you think of that ?	i could add an additional 10 % off the price .	i could lower the price to $ 649 .	i could give you a 20 % discount .	i could come down to $ 600 if you agree today .
all right . we accept it . so $ 600 for each set .	i am happy with 600 .	could you possibly come down to 590 ?	no that's is still too high . i'll check elsewhere	that's great thank you
very well . thank you .	yes	yes , that is correct	yes , that's our rock bottom price	yes , are you ready to complete the sale ?
if you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks .	its really good	i will agree	very good	good
but if i don't pass , will you call me ?	then can we talk about compensation ?	what will the benefits be ?	when is the interview ?	at what time should i arrive for my interview ?
i'm sorry we won't . you can wait for two weeks . if you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful .	we will inform you of our decision no matter what it is .	yes , you will received a call regardless of the outcome .	if you don't hear from us within two weeks , you did not pass the interview .	you will receive a notification call or email within two weeks .
then do i have the chance to get this job ?	ok	ok , thanks for the information	i look forward to hearing from you in two weeks	ok , i'll be excited to hear any news
i'm sorry but i can't make the final decision myself , and i have to discuss it with other interviewers .	you do if you have passed the interview .	upon passing the interview , that is a possibility .	you do if you receive a telephone call .	if you do not get a phone call , then no .
i know . no matter what the result will be , i have learned a lot from our conversation .	ok , i'll be waiting for a response . thank you .	is there another interview process if i pass the first one ?	if i get a call does that mean i am officially hired ?	it would be great if you were able to let interviewees know within a few days if they are successful or not .
your mentality is very good and that's great .	we appreciate your interest in the position and thank you for coming in today .	that's great to hear . it was nice meeting you .	that's great to hear . it was nice meeting you .	that's great to hear . it was nice meeting you .
thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview .	thank you , that means a great deal to me .	i appreciate that , i've enjoyed the interview .	you make the process very pleasant for me . \	i hope i'll see you again very soon .
my pleasure .	thank you for taking the time to interview with us .	thank you for your enthusiasm with our company .	thank you so much for your interest in our company .	thank you for taking the time to interview me today . we hope to keep in touch with you soon .
were you involved in any club activities at your university ?	what were the responsibilities as a student council president ?	what are the requirements to be an excellent party member ?	how many years were you the president of the student council ?	how many students attended your university ?
yes . i was a member of the student poetry society . i like writing poems in my spare time .	yes , i was a member of the chess club .	no , i had enough on my plate focusing on academics and being on the student council .	yes , i worked on the student newspaper .	technically speaking i suppose so ; i was on the debate team and volunteered for a campus animal welfare organization .
what extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ?	do you still write poetry ?	how long were you in the student poetry society ?	did you participate in any readings in the society ?	what type of poetry do you write ?
i sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball .	i was a tutor for some of my classmates that needed extra help .	i arranged and led study groups for my classes .	i volunteered at a soup kitchen during the holidays and volunteered as a camp counselor during the summer for children .	i was involved in the student newspaper as a writer .
i don't know . i just need to try it once . i'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight .	maybe you're thinking about bikram yoga where they turn the heat up high .	there are lots of different levels of yoga , you can work at your own pace .	a beginner yoga class shouldn't be too strenuous .	i think i'll try it , if it's too much , i can just sit down .
you should try swimming then . it helps you to keep fit .	hey , that's great that you're trying to figure out different things . that's half the battle .	go for it ! anything is better than nothing .	you should definitely try it . you may actually end up loving it .	would you like me to do yoga with you ?
ok . please fill in the form first .	sure , is this one suit the only one you want dry cleaned ?	i will make sure the suit is dry cleaned for you .	i can have the laundered clothing back this evening . however i am not sure if the dry cleaning can be done same day . is that okay ?	i have one suit that will be dry cleaned and the rest of these clothes are to be laundered ? correct .
do you do the same exercises every day ?	sounds like a fun idea . where is that park ?	i love running in parks too ! maybe i'll see you there !	what activities do you do after you run ?	great ! how far of a run is it to the park ?
no , i've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push - ups , sit - ups , bunny - hops , five - kilometer run , and so on . i alternate them over the weekdays . sometimes , when i find myself in a bad state , i will simply idle about in the park .	not really . i try different exercises	yes i do . i stick to the same routine	my daily exercise depends on what i plan to achieve	no . my wife actually decides the type of exercise we do daily
why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ?	do you find that your exercise variations help you maintain an overall balance of fitness ?	about how long do you usually exercise for ?	do you work out alone or with a partner ?	on a bad day , does your run and time in the park help improve how you feel ?
it's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it's interesting to join them .	because i need to be getting at least some exercise	i like the park in the mornings	if i am in a bad state , the park makes me feel better	sometimes i do stay in bed if i feel really bad
oh , yes . singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally .	must you keep it	it having much fun	try to wake up earlyer	ok come and join with me

i don't know . but i have a carsickness .	i don't know as this is my first time . what would you recommend in case i have it ?	i sure hope not ! i don't get car sick , is it similar to that ?	i don't know . will getting good sleep help that too ?	since i've never flown this far i'm not sure . do you take some kind of medicine ?
you'd better bring some medicine for airsickness .	carsickness is quite different from airsickness but the remedy is the same	all you have to do is to get enough rest	don't hesitate to notify an attendant if you feel sick	try to eat less before making the trip

i'll come down and watch you play some day , and see what it's like .	ok we will join	what features are in that game	can we play together	what timing
good idea . i think you'll like it if you give it a chance .	i'm looking forward to seeing you on the field .	you'll be a great addition to our team .	i'd love to introduce you to everybody on the team .	i have a feeling that you'll love playing soccer .

right now we have a suite for 4 people , do you want to book it ?	would you like a suite ?	would you like a king size bed or two queen beds ?	do you have an awards card with us ?	i might be able to upgrade you for a small additional cost .
yes , that's what i am looking for . i will take the room for 2 days .	how many bathrooms are there ?	what floor is the suite on ?	i think i'd like it .	ok , i'll take it .
i think you should definitely consider it ! this way you won't have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . i can refer you this great	i get it . it's a tough decision . i can recommend a couple of people if you'd like .	it's hard to find one , but so worth it when you do . mine loves my kids !	yes , i agree . there are a few services that allow you to try a nanny temporarily to see if they're a good fit .	oh i know . it's hard to find someone to help . oh ! maybe a mother's helper would be a good choice . you could even hire a college student .
oh , that's great . thanks grace . can you give me her number ? i'll talk it over with dan and give her a call tomorrow . maybe this way i won't be so tired every day , and dan and i might even get to go	you know what , i will seriously consider it .	well , it would be nice to have some time in my schedule for tennis .	a nanny might be a good solution for me and the kids right now .	i'm glad you suggested the nanny .

you didn't ?	i mean i guess it doesn't really matter .	i don't turn 18 until next year , and then i have to wait !	well aren't you going to tell me who you voted for ?	but tell me , how was it ? !
i really didn't , but i'm still excited .	nope i didn't	i was excited to vote	i never made the connection	i'm just glad it was before election day

alright , i'm twisting it around . you tell me when to stop .	we need to keep you safe , it needs to be tight	i can't make it too tight you'll lose your leg	don't worry about walking i'll carry you	are you sure ? i don't want to hurt you .

oh , ah , um the nikon d60 is a nice option .	how about we check out another one instead ?	the camera next to it has an incredibly long battery life , if you are interested . what do you think about the design ?	trust me . the canon eos is the best and your husband will love it !	have you heard about the canon eos'main competitor ?
yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? i don't want some bulky telephoto lens .	how much is it ?	do you have different color options ?	are there any available ?	when can i buy it ?
oh , well this one has the , uh .	i'm not sure , let me ask my manager .	it comes with the standard lens , but i believe you can get something less bulky .	perhaps you would like something a bit more slender , here are some other options to look at .	it is a large lens , we do have nikon cameras with less bulk .
looks to me like an 18 - 55 mm lens . pretty standard , that will do . not like my husband will be stalking celebrities or anything !	okay , are there multiple options as far as lens kits ?	is there anyone here who knows more about the camera that i could speak with ?	do you know how long its battery life is ?	how does it perform in low lighting ?
so , ahem , can i interest you in any acc . . .	well , you never know .	i'm sure he'll really like this choice .	you've made a great decision . let me get you taken care of at the register .	do you need a cleaning kit to go with it ?
accessories ? do you carry polarizing filters ?	no , thank you . that's all i want .	do you carry nice lens cleaning wipers or something ? my husband will be using it a lot .	do you have other models with the same type of lens ? i would like to make some comparisons .	i will take a memory card .
polarizing filter um we should ! i'm sorry , ma'am . it looks like we're sold out .	yes , we have those right here	we are all out of those filters right now	yes , and we also carry bags for the cameras and the accessories	we have several polarizing filters available

you're getting married in three weeks . so that should be ok . so , you've prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel - everything .	can it be done faster ?	how much will it cost ?	can i pay more to expedite the process ?	i need it sooner .
yes . we've taken care of all of that . we decided not to get married in a church though . neither of us is very religious .	yep , most of the event is set up and ready to go .	yeah , we have most everything taken care of besides the dress .	yeah , everything but the dress is accounted for .	our wedding / event planner has most things taken care of , just waiting on the dress .
which hotel will the reception be held at ?	that makes sense ! where will you be getting married ?	has the venue been booked then ?	i meant wedding venue . . . so you've prepared the venue ?	sounds like everything should be ok for the wedding in three weeks .
the palace hotel they're taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . i'm sure they'll do a good job .	at the plaza downtown .	the small local one at the edge of town , but i can't think of the name .	it will be at the ritz in one of the ballrooms .	as of now , it will be at the howard johnson unless we can get something else before then .
oh , yes . it's and excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .	good choice . i think they are experts .	i hope i did research about them .	is the hotel in your city ?	are they not very expensive ?
yes . it will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . it gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people .	the cost does not matter , my future husband is rich	it is worth the cost , you only get married for the first time once	we are sparing no expense for this wedding	as long as everything goes well , the cost does not matter
i think you make the right decision .	right , experience comes at a price , but it's worth it in the long run .	yes , the last thing you want to do on your wedding day is a worry .	everything i've heard has been terrific , so you shouldn't be worried .	does your contact for the reception stay in touch with you all the time ?
the color is too bright . for my age , i would prefer a lighter color .	thanks , what sizes do you have available ?	great , what colors are there ?	thank you . how much is it ?	where are the dressing rooms ?

sir , i deleted the $ 10 , but i had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill .	of course . there i fixed it for you .	yes , the customer is always right .	there it is all taken care of .	okay all done . is there anything else ?
am i in the twilight zone ? you're charging me for a movie i never saw ?	why would you do that ?	i did not give you authority to do that .	remove that charge	i am contacting your manager .
please don't blame me , sir . blame the computer programmer .	i can connect you with my manager if you'd like .	yes , sir , i'm afraid that's our policy .	i can see how that would be upsetting to you , sir .	give me a moment to speak to my supervisor to see if i can reverse the service charge .
this is highway robbery . i've got a good mind to call the police !	i would appreciate if i wasn't charged for anything , due to the fact that i did not order .	why am i getting the $ 2 charge when i didn't use the service ?	can you please transfer me to your manager so i can get this straightened out .	what does the computer programmer have to do with this charge ? can i speak with them ?
if it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .	i'm only following company policy , sir .	i am sorry for the inconvenience , but this is the best i can do .	if you would like to discuss this with the manager , i can put you in contact with him .	the $ 2 fee is charged to everyone in this type of circumstance , sir .
it's my pleasure . well , then . i'll say goodbye .	you're very welcome .	it's my pleasure .	i'm happy to .	i will see you at 6:30 then !

i don't know what we need .	yes . i made a list .	not really . i have extra money though .	i can wing it . what do you want for dinner ?	of course i do . i do all the cooking anyway .

thanks a lot .	that was fast . thank you .	oh no , there's one bag that's missing .	these aren't mine . my luggage is red .	give me just a moment to check and see if everything is here .
our team was victorious .	joey won	i think joeys team won	team a won by 55 points	they won by a lot .
i wish i was free that night . i'm kind of mad that i didn't go .	that is awesome news !	wow , that's wonderful ! who scored the most points ?	i bet coach was happy !	what was the final score ?
it was a great game .	i'd say you missed a lot	our team was in total dominance	i hope you'll make it to the next game	you can still watch the highlights on espn tomorrow
what was the score at the end of the game ?	yeah , i bet . i always miss the good ones .	man , i'm so bummed i couldn't make it .	yeah , i bet it was amazing .	man , i hate that i missed it , but glad you had a good time and we won .
our team won 101 - 98 .	the score was 0 to 20 .	we dominated them ! we won by like 30 points !	0 - 50 . we scored 50 and didn't let them score a single point !	we won by 10 . it was a 10 - 20 game .
sounds like it was a close game .	great ! it was a close game .	wow , that was close .	wow , that was a back and forth game .	thank god we won !
that's the reason it was such a great game .	yeah . very close and very exciting .	it was definitely a nail - biter !	it was close and one of the highest scoring games i've ever seen .	yeah . hopefully , next time you can make it .
the next game , i will definitely be there .	i wish i would have gone now . oh well .	next time , remind me to put aside everything and join you !	how was the crowd ? how did the crowd react to this victory ?	did you notice anyone or recognize any people we might have known at the game ?
that happens . without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e - shop may suddenly disappear .	that's happened to me once or twice .	it's certainly a possiblity , but you really can't beat online deals !	where did your friends shop ? there are so many online stores to choose from these days .	amazon has a great return policy . if you find clothes there and don't like them , you can return the article .
what's more , it's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password .	your fears are very valid	there are fraudsters all over the internet that's why you have to be careful when shopping online	i'll advise you to use reputable services when shopping online	always opt for shoppers that guarantee a return policy
it's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . paying online is much safer than before , but i still have the feeling that it's not safe enough .	yeah , that's a huge problem as well .	yes , they might . you really can't be too careful .	that's true as well . it's becoming a bigger problem .	that happens too . and the problem is only getting worse .
i can't agree more . that's why i only do street shopping .	yeah , i'm not sure i'll ever feel completely safe buying online .	yup , it seems like an ever evolving thing with security .	i agree . there's always a chance hackers can find how to beat the new system .	definitely . hackers and information leaks scare me .
me too . sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping .	street shopping is safer as long as you choose trustworthy shops .	i stick to chain stores , because i've had bad experiences with independent ones .	i do too , but i watch for card skimmers or getting the wrong change back .	it's also easier to return faulty products when you shop in person .
that's a good idea .	that's a great idea .	that would certainly save time , wouldn't it ?	i might try that next time .	good advice . i also like to keep my money in the local economy .
does the 7th floor belong to our company too ?	are their fares expensive ?	do you have their contact info ?	i'll love to try mitsubishi	kindly list more companies
yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building .	yes , it does . our company operates on several floors .	it does , indeed .	no , it does not .	i don't believe so , no .

yes , at the end of the hall .	yes we have one on the main floor by the lobby .	the restaurant is within the building near the elevator .	yes , we do ! the restaurant is large and has a great menu selection .	the restaurant is exclusive for workers in the building .

well , i'll wait .	not a problem at all .	thank you so much for letting me know .	okay . is there an area for me to wait ?	a few extra minutes shouldn't be an issue . thank you .
would you like something to drink , sir ? do you prefer coffee or tea ?	i have just been informed that mr . johnson is now in the building .	mr . johnson has just been informed to inform you that he will be delayed indefinitely .	mr . johnson sends his apologies and will arrive later than expected .	mr . johnson wants me to let you know that he is now in the elevator on his way up to meet you .
thank you . coffee , please .	no that's alright , i don't need anything .	sure i'll have a coffee .	tea would be great . do you know when he'll be back ?	no i'm just fine . could you tell me where the nearest restroom is ?

where did the break - in happen ?	i'm sorry to hear that . can you give me the address ?	what was the location of the break - in ?	do you know the precise time it occurred last night ?	where you present at the location during the break - in ?
it happened at my house .	it was reported through our system that someone was attempting to enter through the kitchen side door .	the alarm alert system recorded an intruder trying to pry open the window and then tried the door when the window set off the alarm .	the break in occurred during 3:45 a .m . , saturday , march 30 .	the break in happened during the night when all the lights were out .
was anything taken ?	were you in your house at the time ?	we'll send an officer right away to fill out a report .	and what is your address ?	i'm sorry to hear this . was it through a door or window ?
i'm not sure yet .	yes several things were taken	no , i do not think so .	my money was taken and several personal belongings .	i can't tell yet because the place is trashed .
what makes you think there was a break - in ?	have you been in the home since you discovered the break - in ?	do you know if the intruder is possibly still in the house ?	i need your address , please .	are you calling from the house ? i'm dispatching an officer to you .
my front window was busted .	the front door was shattered and there are footprints on the floor tile .	i have a busted window in the kitchen that wasn't there when i went to bed .	there were footprints in one of my children's rooms that are not mine .	my neighbor came to my house and told me they saw someone suspicious in my back yard this morning .
i'll send a squad car .	was anyone home at the time ?	were there any other broken windows or doors ?	was anyone hurt ?	i believe it might be someone you know

now , i'd like to get things under way . the main topic on today's agenda is the development of a u . s . sales strategy for the new ebb . i'd like to hear all of your ideas , mr . wall , you seem in top form today . could you start the ball rolling ?	hello , my name is yang .	no more interruptions please .	now , if i may continue .	thank you for your enthusiasm .
uh , oh , sure . well , i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising .	i'd love to !	i'd be honored to get us started .	sure , if you would like me to .	definitely , i already have a presentation planned for the meeting .
well , that's kind of obvious .	great . thank you for your input . can you elaborate a little more ?	advertising is certainly critical and believe we can all agree on that .	that is a great start to the meeting . and what kind of ads do you have in mind ?	mr . wall , i am sure you came with suggestions as to what advertising would be best . why don't you tell us more .
give me a break , mr yang .	i know , right ? sort of like your name .	obvious , but important .	it's still worth pointing out if we're building a foundation .	well , yeah , but advertising can take many forms .
uh , let's keep this going , shall we ?	mr . wall , you sound angry . is there something that you would like to speak about ?	mr . wall , i beg your pardon ?	i beg your pardon ?	mr . wall , i'm going to politely ask you to refrain from using such unprofessional banter with me and the rest of the attendees at today's meeting .
actually , the factory is located in scotland .	new england , actually . but they are still of high quality .	they are imported from australia and have a unique southern flair .	actually , they are from the state of georgia and are made with unique southern hospitality .	incredible as it sounds but they are made here from the same city .
really ? i didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production	and what sets these apart from other chocolates ?	oh yeah ? does scotland produce unique chocolates ?	does that help with the overall cost ?	what kind of variety do they make ?
that's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here , i brought these especially for you , try one !	indeed , they are ! scotland has some of the best luxury chocolates in the world !	oh , absolutely . scotland has been a worldwide leader in chocolate manufacturing for many years .	they most certainly are . scotland's luxury chocolate production is of the highest quality in the market .	indeed . scotland has been long - known for their top - of - the - line production of luxury chocolates . their reputation for quality and elegance has put them at the forefront of the industry .
oh , thanks . mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth . . .	oh thank you !	mmmm , it looks delicious !	wow that is tasty !	yum , dark chocolate . my favorite !
unique , aren't they ? i bet you've never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection .	glad you like it !	great ! would you like more ?	which one was your favorite ?	it's great you love it .
yes , very interesting flavors . . . slightly spicy , very unique , that's for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ?	wow , i can taste the difference .	i am impressed ! they are unique .	i can tell that corners aren't being cut . the quality shines in these chocolates .	wow ! yumm . can i have another ?
i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations . i'm sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and haggis .	cocoa , butter , and sugar . . . that's it !	for starters , the ingredients are 100 % natural . no artificial colors or flavorings .	i thought you would want to know that , so i brought you a copy of the bonbons'nutritional information . the ingredients are at the bottom .	that spice you taste is cardamom ! it's our first ingredient !
haggis ? what's haggis ?	wow , that is a tremendous chocalate .	your secrets are surely safe with me .	i think it is the buttermilk that makes this stand out .	certainly , so what are the next steps to get this going ?
it's a traditional scottish delicacy , you take sheep's liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep's stomach .	the secret is best	good men	the highest is authority	good
ah , get back to you .	perfect . i think i will take that	that does not sound very good . anything else that you have ?	what else does it include ?	is it on sale ?
mr . johnson ? mr . johnson ?	i will be waiting for your return !	please do . i would be happy to provide more information !	are you sure i can't answer any additional questions first ?	happy to have helped . will be here when you return .
i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , i wouldn't get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility .	that's not a bad idea , lucy .	i have read it . i can fix the light as long as someone holds the ladder for me .	should i find someone else to help me , lucy ?	i think i can fix it , and save the company money . i will read the manual first though .
other company rules also need your attention .	that's correct .	yes , so let me fetch the telephone book and locate the number of a repair man .	unfortunately , that's one rule we can't weasel out of .	i'm glad you understand now .
like this one ? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . yeah , thank you for telling me .	let me just give it a quick look first .	it's not that high , it should be pretty easy to swap out .	lucy , it'll be just fine , you need to relax a bit .	don't worry , i'll wait until the maintenance folks can do it .
don't mention it .	the corridor is keeps flashing	he drives me best crazy	the company is very good	he operating tinseling good
is it too late to mail the continued claim form in now ?	oh no . . . that's disappointing .	is there a way i could send it now and request a late payment ?	please , i'm desperate . . . is there anything you can do to help me ?	all right . i'll be sure to send my next one in , then .
it can't be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it .	no , you can still submit the claim for payment .	unfortunately , claims can not be submitted after the deadline .	certainly not , just fill this out now .	no , but it must be submitted by friday of this week .
i will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem .	i understand . so i missed the deadline ?	ok thank you for explaining .	can i send in multiple forms so it does not happen again ?	so at this point , you can not accept the form ?
you can't possibly know in advance how much you will be working . if you mail it in too soon , we will reject it !	that would be a good idea .	you know , you can also do it online .	that certainly would help , and hopefully this won't happen again .	yes , it's best if we get it several days early to avoid delays .
will my paycheck arrive late because i messed up on my form ?	that's a good point . is there an ideal time to send it ?	that's understandable . i will make sure it's not too soon then .	that makes sense . will try to be more vigilant about the timing in the future .	that's a good point . will figure out the best time going forward . thanks !
your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time .	yes it likely will .	you might not get it at all actually .	it might . make sure you check it for errors before sending it in .	it's possible . be certain to send it on time and check it for accuracy .
i'm going to spend some time exploring the city . what can i do with my luggage ?	i have to be at a board meeting by 10 .	please fetch my jacket , if you'd be so kind .	i'm still suffering from jet lag . difficult to get used to this time change !	now that we know it's morning i should look at my calendar and see what the date is .
sir , right here we have a storage site . its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .	i'll store it in the lobby for you .	i'll take of it for you sir .	i'll have someone store it for you in the coat room .	it can be left here for now sir . i'll have someone take care of it .
a deposit ? isn't my luggage a deposit ?	how much is the deposit ?	do you take credit cards ?	that will work . thank you very much . can i pay now ?	no thank you . that is alot of money .
i'm sorry , sir , but it isn't . your mastercard or visa will take care of things nicely .	i'm sorry sir , it's just the policy .	would you care to talk to the manager ?	i understand that you feel that way , i wish the policy was different .	although i also believe that it should be , i'm just following the rules .
okay . let me think about this .	do you take american express ?	i see . ok , i'd prefer to pay with visa .	do you offer any discounts ?	yes , ok , let me give you my mastercard then .
okay , sir . but don't take too long . you only have 30 minutes .	absolutely , take as much time as you need .	i understand . just let me know when you've decided .	we also take american express .	yes sir .
you can refund it in 7 days and exchange it in one year .	it come with a one year warranty .	it depends on the plan you get with it .	you have to go online and choose a warranty when you activate it .	for life . if it stops working , just bring it back .
that's right .	yes i want to withdraw $ 1000 .	can you please make sure you withdraw them from my checking account ?	wait , not my checking . how about my savings ?	also can you give me the money in all twenties ?
it looks pretty good . i think i'll take it .	wow ! that is way over my budget .	my budget is about 1000 yuan . do you have anything in that range ?	ok , that is a pretty good price . what are the features .	can you tell me features ?
would you like anything else ?	will that be cash or credit ?	great choice ! i think you will be happy with it .	do you also want to get the protective case ?	do you need any accessories for the camera ?
that's all thank you .	no , i don't think so .	i'd like a lot of things , but this is pretty much eating up my budget .	do you have a good cleaning kit you recommend ?	can i purchase an extended warranty for it ?
the sales lady said that even if i eat right , i wouldn't get enough vitamins .	have you even tried it ?	you would be surprised how tasty it is .	i was the same way as you until i gave it a shot .	i was turned off at first too but then i bought some and its become a regular item in my diet .
have you ever tried it ? or are you just going to believe the sales lady ?	yeah , but do you have to drink something green to get them ?	can't you just take a supplement ?	does it taste as bad as it looks ?	well , what all is in it ?
it's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day .	i did some research on it yesterday .	no i haven't tried it yet .	i think she would know what she is talking about	the sales lady says she has tried it herself
it may take less time , but i don't know about easier . yuck .	i think i would have to disagree .	you think this will be easier to get down than a nice salad ?	i don't know . i think i'd much rather go with real food .	okay . to each his own . you're braver than i am .
well , as far as i can tell , we qualify .	is it alright if the ratio is exactly at the average ?	is it alright if the average is lower than average the last two quarters of the year ?	anything else i should keep in mind ?	alright , i'll be sure to remember that .
of course we will need proof , originals and duplicate of everything . as soon as you bring in the proof and we assess it , it should be very quick indeed .	be sure to include your business tax identification number on the application as well .	great , then just let me know when you are done with the application and i will get it processed for you .	there are also capital requirements which need to be met .	are there any other questions i can answer for you ?
did you lose any weight ?	sorry to hear that . has your temperature been elevated ?	are you experiencing any other symptoms ?	are you experiencing any stress in your life at the moment ?	have you made any major changes recently ?
yes . i've lost quite a few pounds since last month .	no , i haven't lost any weight .	yes , i've lost some weight .	i don't think i've lost any weight .	i might have lost some weight . i haven't checked .
when was the last time you have track up ?	how long have you been loosing weight	are you in any pain ?	how many pounds have you lost ?	has this happened before ?
about two month ago .	the last time was a few days ago . should i be worried ?	i think it was last week . i don't quite remember .	maybe 2 days ago ? i'll have to double check my calendar	it was last week . i am worried .
let me take your blood pressure . you look anilic . well , mr . brown . i'm happy to say it's nothing serious . you just a little run down from overwork .	why has it been this long	that is a sign of getting well	this could be mean you are beating it	you will come off it soon
what am i suppose to do ?	oh wow . i should have known .	i m glad its not serious , but i will take it easy for a while .	what a relief ! thanks so much for feedback .	wow i m not surprised . i will take it easy for the next few weeks to recover .
i think you'll needs just vacation . try to get out doors more . i'll be sure if you get more rest .	have you been exercising ?	just try and get your rest .	can you talk to your boss about taking a step back for a few days ?	i would recommend eating more fruits and vegetables and some light exercise .
thank you , doctor . i'll do what you say .	i don't have a lot of free time to get outdoors .	i don't have any vacation time left . is there a medication that could possibly help ?	how will being outdoors help my condition ?	i have a hard time resting . i'm very restless . how can i improve that ?

oh , really ? are there any snakes ?	wow , i had no ides rachel's had so many options .	ok , do they have chinchillas ?	ok , thank you !	i will check rachel's out . thanks !
snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it's a world of exotic pets .	no , there are no snakes , just earthworms	they are lot of snakes there , and it is not safe to be there this night	no snakes at all , it's perfectly safe .	this is a safe haven for snakes , it's too dangerous
that's terrific . i can't wait to check it out .	oh that does sound interesting ! where is it located ?	do they have normal animals too ?	what about parrots ?	are their prices good ?
hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non - traditional pet ?	yeah , most people are scared	most people get disgusted	most people will not visit	most people are not interested in these kind of pets
why not ? it's so cool .	i'm positive ! exotic pets are so unique !	definitely ! owning an exotic pet would set me apart from other pet owners .	of course . you've never thought about owning an exotic pet before ?	why not ? exotic pets are more fun than a usual cat or dog !
but it will pose a risk to your health .	i do nt have time for it .	its just too much work for me .	i like traditional better .	its easier to stick with something basic .
pardon ?	yeah maybe you are right .	i do nt know if i agree with that .	are you afraid of them ?	they can not harm your health if you are careful .
i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems .	i mean the snake might harm you	do you want me to say that again ?	you heard me the first time buddy	i will not repeat myself
well , i didn't realize that .	i didn't know that . i have friends that own snakes , though and have no problems .	really ! ? i didn't know that .	yes , i have heard that before . i don't think it poses enough of a risk to worry .	thank you for your concern . i am aware , however i am not too concerned .
i don't believe it's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children .	well now you know .	will you still get it now ?	what pet do you want now ?	will you change pets now ?
oh , i should have thought of my brother's baby girl . maybe i'll just have a dog instead of an exotic pet .	oh maybe i will think about this some more	maybe i'll look for something more traditional	do you know where i could find a more traditional pet ?	where could i go to adopt a cat ?
yes , good luck , maria .	it is definitely safer to get a dog or cat	a dog is great . they understand humans more and you can get professionals to take care of them easily .	yea , dogs are great , i for one wo nt visit anyone with a reptile as pet	exotic pet are usually much more demanding
would you bring the message to my room .	it's alright	kindly put him on the phone	i will love to talk him	i've been waiting to hear from him

it's martin scorsese . you liked his film , the departed , didn't you ?	let me check the name	i do not know the name	i do not know the director that much	the director is not really famous

how much does the magadize cost ?	maybe we should chip in together and get it .	yeah , me neither .	did you buy this one just for that article ?	magazines subscriptions can get costly after a while .
it's almost three pounds now , and i think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon .	it's around three dollars .	i think about four dollars .	it's $ 3 .99 .	it's $ 4 .50 .
that's quite expensive . who is their target audience ?	let me get my own then	wow , they shouldn't do that	didn't know it was inexpensive	sounds interesting
cosmo mainly has a middle - class readership , but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore .	i'm not too sure .	i'm not sure yet .	i don't know .	you should ask them .
i bet you'll still buy it , though . you wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine !	agreed , that's excessive	hm , maybe they're trying to shift target audiences ?	ugh , that's a lot	yeah it's definitely getting to be a hefty amount
f . y . i . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you're done . . .	that is a good point .	sometimes , supporting local's is more important than a bargain , you are right wei !	that is a good outlook , wei .	you are right , wei .

me too . it always smells so fresh after it rains .	i did not notice that	i do not think rain clears the air	rain does not clear the air though	rain only clears the air somewhat
yes , but i love the night air after it rains .	yeah , and it usually cools the temperature down .	i agree , the smell is so nice .	and of course it helps the flowers grow .	i love the feeling of a rainy day .
really ? why is that ?	i find the night air after a rain to be very relaxing .	same here ; i can always sleep really well the night after a rain .	me too ; everything just seems cleaner .	oh same ! i sometimes have trouble sleeping due to allergies , but the rain washes away all the pollen .
because you can see the stars perfectly .	the air seems more moist .	the air on my skin feels like heaven .	the grass seems greener and has been refreshed .	the animals appreciate the water from the rain .
i really hope it rains today .	i see . i agree there is something so head clearing about a night after the rain is over .	yes , the night air smells cleaner and fresher after the rain has lifted and you have a good view of the stars	the night air is much more crisper smelling and the stars are much brighter looking .	i love to be able to see the night sky after the rain , i see what you mean .
yeah , me too .	me too , i really love a good storm .	i do too , my garden could use some water .	i'm hoping for a clear day for my son's baseball game , but it can rain tonight !	that sounds great . maybe we'll see a rainbow !

do the drivers speak english ?	or maybe i should try an uber ?	well , it's just a few miles so i'd hope it doesn't take long .	traffic seems a little heavy today , how much of an effect would that have ?	all right , sounds fair enough . o
some are better than others . but , you shouldn't have a problem .	yes , most taxi drivers speak english .	i've never encountered a taxi driver that did not know some english .	i've never encountered a taxi driver that did not know some english .	of course the drivers speak english , that would be weird if they didn't .
are they safe ?	i need to know if the drivers are fluent in english ?	i want to request only english speaking drivers .	i think it best if i only use the drivers who are english speakers .	i will not have an issue . i want to request only english speaking driver .s
for the most part , yes . if you don't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night .	yes , they all receive training on customer safety .	i've never had a problem and i've taken quite a few taxis .	yes , if there was a big problem with taxi safety , we'd hear it on the news .	yes , i don't think you will have a problem .
hey . i just played basketball earlier , so my legs are a little sore . let's work out on arms and stomach today .	good idea , i need to strengthen my calves .	i'd rather focus on my core today , if that's all right .	perfect . can't wait to get pumped !	all right , i'll bring some gatorade for after the workout .
i'm on a weekly schedule . you're messing everything up .	okay , i could use the stomach workout .	that is fine i could work on legs tomorrow .	i really wanted to do legs today , but that is fine .	we can squeeze in a light leg workout just to be easy on you .

aright . i'll meet you at the gym at 3:30 then .	ok , i suppose that schedule works .	i'm on a strict schedule , but you can do arms and stomach while i do legs .	you're right , i'll schedule that for friday .	i can't change my schedule , but i guess we can do different routines .
not yet , i pick it up tomorrow .	yes , they gave me the schedule for the next two weeks .	not yet , i'll get my schedule tomorrow .	yes , but it might change over the next few days .	yes , and it works out for me perfectly .

great . make sure you buy me a souvenir !	i hear the pasta in milan is incredible .	you have to try the pizza once you get there .	what food are you the most excited about trying ?	do you have any allergies that will keep you from trying anything ?
oh , don't worry , i will !	you know i will .	where would you like it from ?	is there a particular place you would like it from ?	don't i always ?
what do you feel about gay marriage ?	what do you plan to about climate change ?	what sets you apart from the other candidates ?	what is your position on immigration ?	why should i vote for you ?
i think everyone has the right to love who they want .	i think that anything that forms a family is a good thing .	i think that it creates a strong community to have married couples .	i think all people should be free to follow their hearts .	that's a complicated question , how do you feel about it ?
would you legalize gay marriage ?	i agree with your stance .	i'm glad to hear that . what makes you think that ?	have you always felt that way ?	are you willing to stand behind the stance publicly ?
yes , i would .	i actually have plans to do so if i get elected .	i feel that it would be a step in the right direction .	i believe everyone should have a right to marry .	i would do everything in my power to get gay marriage legalized .
many people won't like that .	what's your opinion on taxes , would you support increases or decreases ?	what about schools , do you support increasing their funding ?	what would you do the address unemployment and homelessness ?	can you tell me about your policy on law enforcement , and other government policies ?
i'm sure they won't , but that's my view on gay marriage .	i understand but that is ok .	but we need to recognize everyone .	i don't worry about that too much .	i think it will be ok to do that though .
i really like you .	that's great !	then you have my vote	you are so brave	you have the lgbt vote then i'm sure
i really appreciate that .	it is their body !	it is their own free will .	it is their choice .	as long as no one is harmed .
i'd like to know more about it .	could you tell me the square footage of the house ?	how much are you selling it for ?	how many bedrooms does it have ?	could i schedule a viewing of the house ?
can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o'clock ?	the house is in pristine condition , and up to date with all appliances and amenities .	the house is located near a scenic trail , and offers spacious parking .	the house was built in the 1950's , but has been recently renovated by the owners .	the house has four bedrooms , two bathrooms , and a one car garage .

yeah , maybe . thanks , anyway . hope you guys have a great time !	absolutely . talk to you soon !	you bet . thanks for understanding .	no problem ! take care .	definitely ! i'll be in touch .
yes . also , i'm not so sure about the color .	yes , this is a small .	no , actually , i think this is a medium .	this one is actually an extra small , so if i could try a small , that would be good .	i believe so , yes . so maybe i should try the medium .
well . it doesn't go with your skirt . i think the color itself is fine though .	we have it in three other colors too .	would you like me to get it in the other colors ?	we have it in several other colors .	i have a similar item , but in another color . would you like me to get that ?
can you just tell me ?	i'm sorry , i really don't .	i'm just kidding . i do know .	i know , i just wanted to see if you did .	i thought it was this tuesday , but someone else told me it was wednesday .
the election is this tuesday .	dude , it's on tuesday .	how do you not know ? every american should know !	look it up !	yup , it's this week . the day after monday .
are you serious ?	what is the date of this tuesday ?	will this tuesday be free fro everyone ?	where will the election hold this tuesday ?	what are the provisions for the election this tuesday ?
i'm not kidding .	yes , do you need a ride ?	yes , do you know who you are voting for ?	yes , but they do have advanced voting today if you can't go on tuesday .	yep , wanna go with me ?
it's a good thing i asked you .	why isn't it on the weekend ?	is early voting available ?	where is my polling location ?	what time do polls close ?
that should've been something you knew already .	you have to go for a short while to vote .	because there is a lot of crowd there .	forget the voter identity card .	we must vote for someone who does good to our country .
i couldn't remember .	well , i've been busy with school the last two weeks so i'm kind of lost in time .	i know i should have , it's always on the tuesday following the first monday in november . what was i thinking ?	i know and i have class all day tuesday , i'll have to go in early to vote .	don't get mad , at least i will vote . the low turnout here in america is a crime .
whatever . just make sure you go vote .	it's been on the news every day .	you should write important dates down in a calendar .	that's why the election board sends out reminders . didn't you get one ?	it seems like you're having a lot of memory problems lately .
keep your voice down . we'll talk more later . right now i need to see vince .	it's a better offer .	i should at least consider their offer .	i don't feel loyalty to this place .	it's very appealing to jump ship .
we definitely have to talk , zina . and watch your back . elvin is still mad about his nose .	is it not better if we talk now	is vince helping with the jumping of ship ?	where are you meeting with vince ?	has vince agreed to meet with you ?
ok , but don't tell anyone what i said .	what happened to his nose ?	well , he really deserved that !	ok , how about dinner after work tonight ?	we really do , can you come over to my house around 7 pm tonight ?
it actually costs less if you have a bus pass .	why do you think it is a waste of money ?	what features and services discouraged you ?	will you be able to correct this issues if necessary ?	is there other means of making the bus pass less look like waste of money ?
how is that ?	but i'm not planning on riding all the time .	even if i won't be on the bus every day ?	i know , but i'm just a little short on cash this week .	i'm contemplating buying a car so i don't want to buy a pass quite yet .
you can use it however many times you need to .	over time you will save a lot of money .	you will be able to use the time saved by taking the bus to earn more money at work .	when you use a bus pass , you don't have to pay for parking .	the bus pass can be used throughout the city when you run errands , too - so it saves you money overall .
is that right ?	i think it will come only for a few days .	and i think some of the rules will be handled .	it can also be crowded when going to the bus .	and i do not know if the bus is in my own time .
yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket .	yes , once a month or 30 rides a month , it costs the same .	plus , it so convenient , you don't have to hassle with cash and change .	yes it is , and your a student so you'll get a big discount to boot .	yes , let's walk down to the station and we can look into buying you one .
that sounds nice .	maybe i will get one -- i like saving money .	but i am buying a car , and i won't use the bus so much any more .	how many times do i need to use the bus to make it worthwhile ?	thanks ! you've convinced me .
you should go get yours .	yeah it is , you should get one .	i buy one every month . the savings really add up .	yeah , you can buy one at the mini mart , the grocery store , the student union .	it may seem like a big expense initially , but it pays off eventually .
yeah , i think i will .	how much does it cost ?	when will i have it in hand ?	what is the other way to ride ?	can i ride without the pass ?
yes .	of course , can i get a number where he can return the call ?	is there a certain time that he should call you back ?	certainly , he should be back in the next hour or so i think .	can i tell him what this is in reference to ?
from video tv .	can you please ask him to call me back ?	please tell him i have a question and need him to return my call .	please let him know i need to hear from him as soon as possible .	have him get back to me whenever he is free to talk .
yes , video tv .	can i have some information ?	what kind of entertainment are you broadcasting in your company ?	how much money do you buy that broadcasts ?	how much money do you buy for a day ?
tell him i telephoned . i'd like to see him about the videotapes . can he call me this afternoon ?	tell him it's about our lunch meeting on wednesday .	i want to discuss installing that new control panel in the monitoring room .	the largest provider here in the city .	remind him that we need to discuss all the materials he needs for that upcoming project your building .
yes , of course . what's your telephone number ?	he won't be back tomorrow , i'm afraid .	i'll give him the message , sir .	i'm sure he will call if he has time .	he will be on a conference call all afternoon .
it's , area code 413 , 447 - 9626 .	my telephone number is 231 - 8745 , thank you so much !	my number is 398 - 8545 , i am available until noon today and all day tomorrow .	387 - 9945 , again that is 387 - 9945 .	my number is 399 - 1984 please let mr . johnson know that i am at the office all day .
that is 413 - 447 - 9662 ?	what is the best time to call you ?	should he ask for suzuki ?	would you like to call him back also ?	would you like to take down his personal number ?
no , that's 447 - 9626 .	no that is incorrect .	nope that's not my telephone number .	you got the last four digits of my phone number wrong .	no i'll repeat it's area code 413 447 - 9626
oh , i'm sorry , 447 - 9626 .	oh sorry about that . 447 - 9626	447 - 9626 got it	i see i'm sorry	okay i got it this time
yes , that's right . extension 162 .	no problem , thanks for taking the message .	correct , area code 413 as well .	don't worry you have the correct number to contact me now .	i look forward to hearing from him .
extension 162 . okay , mr . suzuki . i'll give him the message .	i will pass along the message .	is there a good time to call you back ?	he will be back in shortly and i'll have him call you .	is there anything that i can help you with in the meantime ?
thank you . good - bye .	do you have any idea when you expect him ?	does he return calls the same day ?	would you mind if i call back later today ?	what time does he leave the office for the day ?
good - bye .	you're welcome . good - bye to you .	no problem . anything else that i can help you with ?	my pleasure . have a good day .	mr . johnson will contact you as soon as possible , anything else ?
banana pie .	chocolate pudding .	i am on a diet and will pass on dessert .	cheesecake , but no berries .	i have a snickers in my purse , so i will just stick with that .
where shall we sit ?	do you think they made that here , from scratch ?	that's something new	i think i'm going to cheat on my diet and have some cheesecake	i can't decide because it all looks good
how about there ?	how about over there by the window ?	there's two spots there at the end , i'll get on the other side .	i see my friend sally over there , let's sit with her .	i like the round table over there by the door . that way we can watch who comes and goes .
what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog .	you said that before and it never happened	i don't believe you	i'll be the one handling it	not going to happen , sorry
ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ?	so lets get a smaller dog that better fits the apartment .	we can have the dog boarded in a kennel if we go on vacation .	we could leave it with friends or family if we really need to .	we can look for a larger apartment .
we're planning on having children soon , i don't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house .	we still need someone to care for them when we take a vacation .	who is going to pay the vet bills ?	these pets are still alot of work .	i'm sorry , but we are not getting any kind of pet .
fine ! let's get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome !	we could get a fish !	how about a turtle ?	i suppose a child could be considered a type of pet .	those japanese moss balls are pretty easy to care for and lots of people regard them as pets .
i'll tell you what , i can get you some hamsters and we'll take it from there .	no , i'm done with this conversation .	that	that would be kind of neat .	i don't like the idea of a caged bird , too cruel .
yay !	that can work too , i love hamsters .	ehh , i really don't think i am hamsters friendly .	no , but i am thinking on a fish instead . they require very low maintenance and space .	but i still insist that a small dog will be harmless and considering my care , you and our child will not notice .
here's the swimming pool . it's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . there are also massage rooms here .	we have exercise classes as well .	we also have a track .	we offer personal training , which is a great way to get started .	we offer nutrition counseling as well .
that's wonderful ! i like swimming .	what types of massage do you offer ?	is there a steam room for after the massage ?	is there a lifeguard at the pool ?	are there swimming lessons given ?
after a year together , i thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together .	no , i only think alaska is really not the right place to enjoy hunting	its funny , because you can easily frost over there .	the only thing you're likely to hunt is a polar bear	it doesn't bother me , i see no reason for that to bother me . but i would appreciate if you ask me if i'd like to go there too .
says who ? i don't think that is necessarily the case .	you never mentioned anything to me	you should have told me sooner .	how was i to know ?	sorry , should i tell mark no ?
you know , now that i think about it , i really don't have much more to say to you at all !	it's a known thing that couples vacation together !	says almost anyone ! i've been looking forward to it .	every couple i know goes on vacation together .	you're being ridiculous . it's definitely a thing for couples to vacation together .
whatever you say !	you can try going fishing with me	hunting is fun why don't we try it	i would appreciate if you follow me this time	why not try something new
certainly . no one who evades tax can escape from their detection . they'll check your income through computers . you'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . if you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined .	i'm no tax expert but i'm pretty sure they would find it out .	i'd definitely say that they will .	yes ! you'll get in a lot of trouble too .	you have to pay your taxes . it's the law .
what happened ?	i understand but you have to calm down	still not enough reason to shout	take things easy	i understand your frustration but have a rethink
i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog , so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i couldn't fall asleep , because brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me .	refused to do the dishes he dirtied .	told my girlfriend i was a loser .	wants to use the rent money to go gambling .	he is a slob never cleans up his own messes .
what ? he can't do this to you .	is brain mentally unstable ?	that sounds like a reasonable request .	you should get a new roommate .	do you have any ear plugs ?
well , he did it anyway . then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah . . . you know .	he was really rude . i don't know what to do .	i didn't even know what to say .	i can't figure out why he was so angry . i thought i was polite about it	i'm a little worried about him .
what did you do ?	you are going to have to get a new roommate .	this guy sounds dangerous , you need to get out of this arrangement , like now !	this guy is bad news , get out of this , now !	i will help you and you have to get out of this arrangement , this is really bad !
i shouted it back of course .	i decided to be the better person and forget all about it .	i took some alone time to stew and got over it .	i spoke right back at him angrily .	i just pretended to ignore what he said .
hold it , mike . you won't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? you worked it all up till now . why not wait until you cool down a bit ?	how did he respond to that ?	that was rude .	he's so loud .	how did you respond to that ?
what would you do if you were in my shoes ?	i couldn't help it . he was really annoying me .	you're probably right . i just lost my temper .	i should have waited . i was just really angry with him .	that's good advice . i should do that next time .
just stay cool . you know . when you get back home tonight , tell him that you didn't mean to quarrel with him .	i'd schedule a meeting time when you are both calm to discuss the matter .	i'd start looking for a new roommate .	the two of you should establish quiet hours and stick to them .	you could give him a taste of his own medicine and start blaring the stereo when he is asleep .
no way , kate . i mean it's just not my fault .	right now i really don't feel like talking to him .	i guess i can tell him i was just tired and snapped	i really can't stand him right now	i'm afraid it'll just turn into another argument
i know . it wouldn't hurt much to say sorry first . and after that , you can casually mention the problem . i am sure he will cooperate .	i suppose it's not .	i just think you should give it a try .	are you sure you won't reconsider ?	but wouldn't it make you feel better if you did ?
i am too angry to do that .	okay .sounds like a great idea .i'll give it a try .	i don't know if it'll work kate but thanks for the advice anyway .	you think apologizing would work ?okay i'm going to take your suggestion .	do you seriously think it would work ?
i like playing cards . i'm pretty good at poker . do you play cards ?	what is the first thing to learn if you want to play ?	could you teach me ?	do you want to play ?	i'm not sure i'd be very good at it .
i'm terrible at cards and so i never play games which involve gambling , like poker . if i did , i'd lose all my money .	i like cards , too , let's play cards !	oh , i like poker too ! we'll have to play poker sometime !	sure , i'm always up for a card game !	i used to play cards a lot and sure i would play sometime !
do you play bridge ?	i like playing gin rummy with cards as well .	not all games with cards require gambling .	i like to play uno with cards with no gambling involved .	all card games are not equal in difficulty , i am sure there is a fun card game for you .
yes , i do . it's hard to find four players though , so i don't play very often . do you know anyone who plays ? if so , we could set up a game .	bridge is too complicated . i could never learn it .	unlike other card games , i'm great at bridge . my aunt taught me .	nah , i'm no good at cards .	sometimes . do you ?
i can play quite well . i have a friend who likes playing , but she's not very good at it . shall i invite her to play ?	i think some of my friends do . i could see if they are interested .	i think i could find enough people so we could play .	it shouldn't be too hard for me to find some people .	i know quite a few people who would want to play . i'll get it set up soon .
sure , i have a friend who play fairly well . we should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game .	sure , it will be a good way for all of us to ease our way into the game .	well , i'd rather not play with someone who is just in the learning stage .	as long as she like the game and is up for a little advice , i don't see why not .	i suppose it just depends upon just how bad she is .
i'll call my friend now . you call yours .	that would be great	yes let's i will see when my friend is available	check with your friend and i'll check with mine and we can coordinate	what other games do you like ?
great . what types of things will we do at lushun falls ?	three star is not great , is it a nice enough hotel ?	how long are the stops during the day/	do we eat dinner together as a group and is it included ?	why is the hotel rated only three - star ?
the second day you take a four - hour city tour . in the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls .	you could visit the falls themselves .	i would suggest going to the local carnival .	there is a large shopping center in the middle of town you might like .	could go swimming in the hotel pool and relax .
well , he shouldn't be long . he said he was just going to get some paint . but i wouldn't be surprised if he's stopped off at the pub on the way back .	no , i have no idea , but you can call him on his cell if you would like to .	he should be back any minute now . should i ask him to call you ?	he should be back soon but you can call him on his cell .	i am not sure , he can take calls on his cell .
ok . well , tell him i've called , will you , and i'll try again later .	why would he be going to the pub ?	do you happen to have his cellphone number ?	could you have him call me immediately when he returns ?	ok , i will try another time , thanks .
all right . goodbye , dave .	can i take a message ?	i'll let him know .	yeah , try again in a couple of hours , dave .	hopefully he'll be here soonish .
thanks then sally . goodbye .	goodbye sally , and you have a nice evening .	thanks for your help sally .	bye - bye sally .	ok , don't forget to tell him i called , ok ?

one thousand eight hundred yuan .	it's very expensive .	what is your price range ?	it's $ 500 today .	today it is on sale and will be 20 % off original price .
it's not expensive . i'll take it .	do you happen to know how much that is in us dollars ?	that's a high price . are you willing to go down a bit ?	let me bring my wife back here and see what she thinks . what time do you close ?	great , i'll take it . do you have any other porcelain products ?

that sounds good . but i have a proposal now .	i hope so too .	when is the soonest you can deliver ?	can you tell me your pricing for the silk shirts ?	i agree to your terms and have already signed the contract .
what's the proposal ?	that's too bad .	i hope you have a good day then !	what proposal ?	would you like to see or know anything else about our products then ?
both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ?	can we sit down so i can review it with you ?	i'd like to order a three dozen of the shirts and two dozen coats .	i'd like to break my purchase into two shipments per season .	i have written it out , i'll hand it to you now to review .
good idea ! in this way , our clients'needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided .	i think that would be fine .	which clients are you speaking of ?	i think we should spend a little more time in closed discussions before letting in the clients .	that would be fine . i have a few clients i would like to invite as well .
sounds like we have the same idea .	thank you , i'm very happy you agree . i think it would help facilitate a agreement .	great , i'll will contact the clients on my end and get it started .	good , i'll contact my client . what day and time would be convenient for you ?	let me know what times and days you have available and i'll see what i can get set up .
can i get a quick reply from the sites ?	when will i hear back from them ?	how do i know they have received my application ?	are there websites for field - specific applications ?	how can i view specific job postings ?
yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while .	sometimes the response time can be pretty quick .	not always , make sure to check when the job listing was posted because if it's too old it might have already been filled .	generally the response time should be timely .	i'm sure they will !
can you tell me more ?	do you have any in stock ?	how much does that cost ?	does it work well ?	that sounds good , i'l like a bottle please .

don't worry about a thing ; we are just taking a second look and talking .	we won't know that until we run the tests and get the results .	keep a positive frame of mind we don't know anything at this point .	it's natural to be apprehensive but we don't know anything at this point .	we're just looking into this to make certain you have no cause for alarm .
do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease ?	okay , you will have to take a test to prove it !	here is your written exam .	then you will have no troubles with the examination .	i will need you to write me some things to prove that .
yes , i think i can in ordinary circumstances .	yes , i am fluent in english so it would not be a problem .	yes , i am quite confident that i can .	certainly . i have never had any problems with people understanding my english .	i do believe that people can easily understand my english .
do you think you can speak english quite fluently ? tell me about your english education .	may we test your proficiency	do you have any certificate of english certification ?	what about extraordinary circumstances ?	that's good , it's very important
yes , i think i speak english quite fluently . i got a high score on toefl . i majored in english in college .	yes , definitely . i took a lot of classes in school and practice on my own as well .	yes , i have been learning english since i was five years old .	yes , i don't struggle much having conversations in english anymore . i practice everyday .	yes , i think i am quite fluent at this point . i have studied english in school .
ha ! that's right . you used to smoke . i forgot !	i see . when was that ?	how did you respond to that challenge from him ?	what did he say or do to try and convince you to quit ?	were you able to quit successfully ?
when i kicked that habit , i found i had so much more energy . i started exercising .	yes , i'm cigarette free now !	it was hard to quit , but i got there	yes , and i used to drink a lot too	yes , i was a heavy smoker before
at the gym ?	what else did you do ?	how hard was it to smoke ?	how hard was it to smoke ?	have you changed anything with your diet ?
no . i like to be outside . i took up hiking and mountain biking .	yes , i did join a gym .	no , i don't care for indoor exercise .	actually , i started running and am training for a half marathon .	i've started doing all kinds of physical things in and outside a gym .
oh , yes . i had a look yesterday . i found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . the exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . i've gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . i've got some idea of your exports . i'm interested in your silk blouses .	the exhibition halls are very impressive . i would like to be able to shop for some of the things on display .	i would like to see some of the more popular sites in the city . where would you recommend i go ?	do you have any suggestions for me for dining out ?	my daughters would like to go to a shopping mall . can you recommend one ?
our silk is known for its good quality . it is one of our trade - trional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . they've met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand .	thanks for your interest . do you need more information of our silk blouses .	thanks for your interest . how many silk blouses do you want ?	thanks for your interest . we have other silk blouses . do you want see them ?	you have a good eye . our silk blouses are very popular .
i think it should be casual .	i'm going for something somewhere between formal and casual .	definitely casual , so i'm thinking easy finger foods .	formal , so i want to make sure there's nothing with heavy sauces or oils that can ruin dresses and tuxedos .	i'm leaning towards casual , but we have some employees that are vegan and others with some food allergies we need to consider .
i agree . next , we have to decide on food . we have a choice of chinese or continental cuisine . which one should we have ?	wings and pizza are perfect choices .	i think casual tastes the best .	casual food is tasty , easy to make and simple to clean up .	casual food is sometimes better than super high end expensive food .
i would prefer chinese food for this party .	i'm not sure . which one do you think more people like ?	i think chinese is probably the best , don't you ?	maybe we should serve portions of both .	continental cuisine might be too much for something casual . let's stick with chinese .
perfect choice . for music , should we have a live band or a dj ?	would you like a variety of options ?	we can make sure a couple different types of soup are ordered as well .	do you think we should do chopsticks as well as spoon and forks ?	should we do spicy and mild chinese ?
i think we should hire a live band .	let's go with a dj .	i think a dj will be more affordable .	i can't decide , what do you think ?	do you think a live band is too much ?
ok then . well , i will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on friday .	i think everyone would prefer a live band .	a dj would save us some money .	a live band is always more fun than a dj .	i'd like a variety of music , so i choose a dj .
i need job security .	honestly , i really value both .	i tend to value job security just a tad bit more , but the chance to advance is important , too .	i really value professional growth . i guess i feel that if i have a chance to advance and prove myself , i create my own job security .	both equally , but i also really value the people and environment , as well .
would you be able to relocate ?	try getting a job you like doing .	if a job pays enough and you like it then work hard at it .	i am not sure if job security exists .	security is important but happiness is everything .
i am open to relocating .	i'm open to relocation for the right opportunity .	i would be willing to relocate , yes .	no , i would not want to relocate .	i'm open to relocation if it is the right fit .
what are your annual salary requirements ?	where are you currently located ?	where are you right now ?	sounds good . what are your salary requirements ?	can you tell me more about your previous experience ?
i need at least 75 ,000 per year .	i would need at least 100 ,00 a year . is that okay ?	is 50 ,000 a year good ?	can we do this some other time ?	are you okay with 100 ,000 a year ? i have a wife and kids .
i'll keep that in mind . thank you for coming in today . we'll be in touch .	the lowest i would be willing to accept is 75 ,000 .	i'd like to ask for 95 ,000 at this time .	$ 100 ,000 would be ideal .	the minimum i would accept is 75 ,000 .
that's right . just a simple multi - vitamin that i can take every day .	yes multi vitamin is super important .	no i want just vitamin c and d tablets .	i want a multi vitamin but a gummy chew - able .	i want a multi vitamin that is cheap not an expensive one .
okay . then i recommend this one . it's made especially for men about your age .	great , i'll help you narrow it down . do you want a generic or brand name ?	ok , that should be easy enough . did you have a particular brand in mind ?	let's try to find something then . is there one you've taken in the past that you liked ?	ok , sure . do you have a preference on price ?
oh ! you took the guesswork right out of that one .	would you like a liquid multi vitamin ?	are you looking for a vitamin that you can take on an empty stomach ?	would you like tablets or capsules ?	would you like a probiotic with the multivitamin ?
that's my job ! is there anything else i can assist you with ?	haha .	that's my job , after all !	any other questions ?	this one is very popular .
do you have any product that controls frizz ?	i would like for you to shampoo and condition my hair first please .	i have a lot of split ends so i want to ensure those are taken off as well .	please don't cut my bangs much at all .	what is the best way i can ensure it stays healthy ?

i'm going to dinner with my family .	i need to study for a big exam on monday .	my mother is coming to visit .	i have a first date with someone i've been trying to get to go out with me .	it's my aunt's birthday and i'm spending the evening with her .
i really wanted you to come , but i understand .	ok , see you some other time !	oof .	you have my condolences .	say hi to your sister for me .
yeah , maybe next time .	remember family always comes first	you can join us for dinner	fix another time	can you come now ?
i'll hold you to that .	maybe i can do both , what time is the party ?	definitely , i hope to have another party in 2 months .	if your plans change feel free to stop by .	ok well have a good dinner with your family .
sounds like a plan .	i promise i will come next time .	will you please forgive me ?	okay , i'll take to you later .	have fun at the party . i'll be there in spirit .
it's true .	what exactly is call transfer ?	could go into more detail to what call transfer is ?	how much exactly is handset charge ?	how much time do we spend in the office ?
call transfer has many other advantages . when i am in places where network can't cover , such as the high building , i also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand - free telephone and i will not miss any call .	you can try it out too	how large are your charges	you need to be like me man	it is really sweet when you spend less
that's all ?	do you ever have issues dropping calls ?	how much does the technology cost ?	how long have you been using call transer ?	will you please come show how to use the call transfer function ?
in hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip - ment , so we must close our handsets . if you set call transfer , the problem will be solved .	yep , that's it ! and it's cheap , too !	that's all i can think of right now .	yes , it's just that simple .	you have to pay extra for it as well .
i don't understand why .	i have asked for maintenance to fix multiple things and it hasn't happened . i can't live here under those conditions .	someone was in my place when i was at work . i don't know who it was but they had a key . i feel very unsafe and have to leave .	it is in my contract to have heat and ac and i can't get ac unless someone decides it's okay . that is not acceptable and in breach of my contract .	i have sent you several emails and left countless messages and no one calls me back . i am not going to stay here under these conditions .
i'm going to have to keep your deposit	it breaks the leaser	you signed the lease	it hurts me financially	you can not leave because of the lease
why can't i have it back ?	but why are you going to keep my deposit ?	how much did i give you for my deposit ?	how long do i need to stay ?	can you fix my house problem ?
because you're leaving before your lease is over .	it is stated in the terms of the lease agreement you signed .	tenants are required to give advance notice prior to moving out . that's what the lease agreement said .	there is damage to the apartment , and as per the terms of the rental contract that means you forfeit the deposit .	you are forfeiting the deposit by moving out without supplying proper advance notice .
you have to give it back to me .	surely leaving sooner would make me entitled to my deposit as you can find a new tenant earlier , right ?	i've paid in full every month i have no balances , why are you doing this ?	i don't think that's fair , i still paid for the month you can't hold this against me !	if i find a replacement for me would you give my deposit back ?
you're not going to get it .	nope , the rules state that the deposit does not have to be returned in this situation .	i'm afraid the rules stipulate otherwise .	no , i actually don't , and the property manager has this in print per the agreement .	you signed a contract that indicates that you must stay the full duration of a lease in order to get the deposit back .
but i'm not able to live here anymore .	you'll be hearing from my lawyer .	i believe i am entitled to it .	why not ?	you do nt have any right to keep my deposit .
i can't help you with that .	i m sorry but i ca nt give it back	well your lease is not over and you re leaving .	just speak to my lawyer	its all on the contract so i m sorry .
thank you .	i am always happy with the haircuts i get here .	thank you , and i left a tip for you as well .	thanks , have a nice day !	you always do a wonderful job with my hair . thank you !
wait ! congratulations ! you are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration .	how old is your son ?	does your son like to cut hair ?	what will you buy with your money ?	do you like the payment amount ?

which anti - virus program would you recommend ?	what kind of websites do you visit , why are you getting viruses all the time ?	that makes me worried about my computer . thanks for the tip .	i think you need a new antivirus program as the one you're using right now seem to not be too effective .	you should not constantly get viruses . what programs are you downloading from the internet ?
have you tried this one ? it's very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free .	i'd suggest norton	i'd suggest malwarebytes	hm , it depends on your use	i recommend blocker
that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ?	thank you for the recommendation i will try it .	does it have a large number of good reviews or do i just take your word for it ?	ok thanks , i'll research it some more and definitely consider it .	no i have nt , but i will !
just a minute . . . go to this one . i'll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated .	you should visit software .com	you should go to softonic website	i ca nt recall but i sure you can find it using google	i do nt remember the site sorry .

what are your rates ?	ok	930am right ?	good , see you then	excellent .
it is rib 10 yuan initially and 2 yuan for each kilometer .	from fucking road , the rates begin at 5 dollars per mile .	it varies by location and distance , where are you trying to go ?	if you give me your location we can provide you with a quote .	5 per mile for the first 10 miles then 8 dollars per mile
i have a lot of luggage . will those fit in the taxi ?	ok that sounds great .	that s a bit expensive	i love those rates , keep them and you will have a faitfull client	ok thanks a lot for the info
take it easy . i'll send a larger to pick you up .	yes the taxis are quite large	how many bags do you have ? i could send an suv	it depends on how much you have . i can fit 4 large suitcases	yes they will
thank you very much .	is there an extra charge for a second passenger ?	i would like to bring my dog along . do you allow pets in your taxis ?	do you allow smoking in your taxis ?	what kind of vehicle should i be looking for ?

thanks . well , those two kids are beginners . what should i do about their safety ?	do we have to wear helmets ?	those all look adult size .	when did you start renting helmets ?	have those been sanitized ?
well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . first , make sure they don't go far from the railings .	you should wear these helmets .	you can sign up for our safety course	would you like some papers about safety ?	here is a safety brochure for you and your friends .
oh , yeah , maybe i should ask them just to walk along the railings .	ok , but do i need any extra equipment for them ?	ok , anything else i should watch out for ?	sounds good , should i take any other precautions ?	thanks . anything else you would suggest ?
that's a good idea . and remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings .	that would be a good idea , i think .	that is probably a wise decision to start out . how old are the kids ?	that might be the safest option . is it the first time ever for these kids ?	a lot of people do tend to start out by sticking to the railings , so the kids might be most comfortable that way .
ok . anything else ?	is it crowded ?	are there a bunch of rowdy teenagers racing around ?	do you have any knee and elbow pads ?	when do you close ?
never go to the center of the lake . the ice there is too thin to skate on .	not really , just remind them to go at a slow pace .	they should return the skates here when they finish .	no , just remind them to be careful .	yes , you should also keep in the safe zone away from pro skaters .
got it . thanks for reminding me . and , are there any intensive training courses ?	are there any fish in the lake ?	will the thinner ice break ?	have you had any ice accidents this year ?	how deep is the lake ?

that's coincident .	she has been ill this whole time .	i understand your frustration , but it is a serious illness that she has been dealing with	if you want , i could have her doctor provide documentation	i am sorry but i really need you to believe me . it is a difficult time for my family .
ok , hold it . remember to be punctual next time .	if you don't straighten up and fly right , your days here are numbered .	you're not taking your responsibilities very seriously .	is that supposed to be funny ?	do you even have a sister ?

i'm not sure , but i don't think she's given out that many .	i think like thirty people or so	i'm not positive , but most people i've talked to have gotten an invite	i heard she was inviting the entire class but i'm not positive	i only know of about ten others who have gotten an invite from her
well , hopefully she'll give me my invite later on today .	i wonder who is coming .	i hope it will be fun .	i hope it is fun .	i hope we have a good time .

well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices .	there is sweet tea and water .	there is milk and water .	there is unsweet tea and water .	there is orange juice and milk .
in that case , let me have a glass of orange juice .	is there iced tea available ?	i don't really like fruit juices . what flavors of soda do you have ?	i would like a cup of coffee .	are the juices sugar - free ?

another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea .	would like milk , cream , or almond milk to go with that ?	you dinner includes a choice of sides ? do you have something in mind ?	no problem . might i interest you in some chocolate cake for desert ?	we have quite a few teas to chose from . do you have a favorite ?
i see .	sounds good , thanks .	very well , i appreciate it .	oh okay . i will wait .	can you please get it ?
i'm afraid not .	no .	i do not .	i do not have an account .	yes i do .
in that case i highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . that would help with your credit card application .	would you like to open a new account with us ?	it would be in your best interest , for approval - standards , that you open an account with us .	regretfully , we require credit card applicants to be a current member of our bank . would you like to open an account with us , now ?	that is fine ! we have some fantastic sign - on offers for new customers . would you be interested in this information ?
what is the interest rate on your card ?	i will consider it .	i will think about it .	that sounds like a plan .	okay .
the annual charge rate is 9 . 5 % .	that depends on your expected income and level of debts .	we had three tiers of credit cards available .	it depends on which bank accounts you sign up for .	if you don't have any credit history , the rate will be high i'm afraid .
that's very expensive !	are there transaction fees ?	what are the terms and conditions ?	is this a prepaid credit card ?	are prepaid credit cards really credit cards ?
not really . the credit card is a revolving account . you only pay interest on what you owe .	credit cards can go up to 18 % interest . this isn't half bad .	it's really not that bad for unsecured credit .	if you don't keep a balance , you won't pay interest .	were you looking for another type of loan ?
how does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ?	so you are saying if i pay it off i will pay not interest ?	even still , other banks have quoted me lower !	what is the benefit of a checking account for the card ?	can you explain that more to me , this is my first credit card .
you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized .	yes , the card is administered by the bank .	no , the card is a separate visa service and visa will bill you .	yes , we handle all charges , fees , interest , and payments .	you'll received a monthly statement , either paper or electronically .
does the card provide any other benefits ?	how will i receive the monthly statement ?	how do i get the monthly statement ?	what if i don't want a monthly statement ?	i do not need a monthly statement
you can also get a cash advance up to 1 ,000 dollars on this card .	there are no benefits .	you get to use the atms .	you get customer service .	there are no other benefits .
wow ! how often do you exercise like that ?	is that safe ?	do you wear pads ?	do you like bicycling ?	do you do that often ?
about five times a week . what about you ?	that depends on the weather mostly .	everyday , without fail .	at least 6 days a week .	not as much as i like , that's for sure !
oh , i hardly ever exercise . i usually just watch tv in my free time . i guess i'm a real couch potato !	i hit the gym everyday	chasing my kids around is enough exercise for me .	my job keeps me fit .	i run three days and play tennis

ok . thank you . goodbye .	i will	i will not call back later	i am reporting you instead of calling back	i would rather not
all right , can i have your passbook ?	that is a awful lot of money	that is too much money	i can not give you that much money in traveler's checks	i need to speak to my boss about that
yes , here you go .	sure , here you go .	no , i don't like to lend it out .	sure , but be careful with it .	yes , you can .

thanks .	thank you .	have a nice day !	i bet you're tired from working today .	my vacation has officially started .
just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem .	it is just the kitchen .	the kitchen is the only problem .	only the kitchen is affected .	the kitchen is the only issue .
did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ?	did you pour any type of drain clog solution into the sink ?	have you tried running the shower and bathtub faucet ?	is the water stagnant , or does it slowly recede ?	i'll contact our maintenance staff . they should be there within the hour .
everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago .	it just happened .	it has been going on for a while .	it only just happened .	it is a regular ocurrance .
are you going to be home so i can come by and take a look at the problem ?	was anything put down the drain ?	can the water be shut off for a few hours while we work ?	we will get someone there as soon as possible .	what time can we come help you out ?
i am not sure if i will be home later .	i am home now .	i can be here whenever you are available .	my roommate or i will be here .	i have to be at work in a few hours .
i will be coming by around 10 this morning . if you aren't there , i'll just use my key .	do you want me to look at it without you ?	how about tomorrow ? or is it more urgent ?	well , if you want to get this taken care of , you should give me a time .	i'm happy to look at it for you , just let me know when .
oh , my god , three hours already ! i have to get the chores done !	i can't believe it's that late !	i completely lost track of time !	wow . the last time i looked at the clock it was seven !	it's getting late . i should probably head to bed , soon .
no time . that's their headlights in the window !	you better hurry .	you should get started .	good luck .	i hope it goes well .
ok , emergency measures . let's throw the dishes in the trash ! two birds with one stone . . .	wow they got here fast !	better save my game then .	they are gon na be so mad at me .	time flies when you are having fun !
little dude , your life is over !	you can't be serious .	well i guess we won't be going to that party tonight .	let's just run away .	maybe they won't notice .
no time to worry . we have to dispose of this evidence .	i know , i'm going to be in big trouble .	ugh , i'm going to be grounded	my dad is going to blow a gasket .	crap , you're right .
he's fine . he retired last week . it's a turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement .	he is fine .	he is not doing to well .	great ! how is yours ?	i have not spoken to him in a few weeks .
he can spend more time with his grandchildren .	i can't wait to retire .	i bet he is having the time of his life .	that's cool .	he deserves it .
oh , i don't think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world .	yes , and he will love that .	he also has more time for his hobbies .	i'm so happy for him	he does love his grandchildren !
so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea !	oh , really ? where does he want to go ?	that's interesting . where is he looking to travel ?	how nice . what countries is he considering ?	how adventurous . where does he want to go exactly ?
how do you want to spend your old age ?	yeah , it is good .	you are right .	i agree .	i am in agreement with you .
in the same way , probably .	i'd love to travel . i don't have much time to do it now , but when i'm older , that's what i want to do .	i'd love to go on a cruise and backpack through europe !	i'd rent a motorhome out and tour the country .	i'm not sure . i really haven't thought that far ahead !
it's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if i am a well - rounded person by looking at it ?	i never thought of it like that .	maybe you're right .	can i use your computer to edit it in ?	i hope it gives me a leg up then .
well , you're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . that's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they can't see from a piece of paper . but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer .	the resume is often the first impression , so i think it can be important .	it can't hurt to give that impression from the resume .	it's just a piece of paper , but it's very important for setting the tone .	it's just a suggestion , i think it will help your chances .
of course . we will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business .	you will have free time in the evenings .	the events are mainly during the day .	yes , you have free time at night .	none of the events are mandatory .
it's too small for me to wear .	it shrunk overnight .	it has a weird stain on it .	my fiancee hated it .	i lost it .
would you like another bigger one ?	i understand . let me examine the item .	would you like to this refunded to your credit card or to store credit ?	would you like to have the shirt in a different size ?	i am sorry , but the item is too damaged to return .
no thanks . i want to have a refund .	yes , please the other one was too small .	yes , please .	no .	i would like a refund instead .
ok , here is your money .	okay i will start the refund process .	i am sorry we do not offer refunds . we can only replace it .	okay i will call my manager to handle the refund .	it looks good on you , are you sure you want a refund ?
may i try it on ?	thank you very much .	i appreciate the compliment . thank you for letting me know .	can i try it on ?	how much does it cost ?
go ahead .	sure , have at it .	of course !	here you go !	it looks amazing on you !
is there a mirror around here ?	how much does it cost ?	it's a little big , do you have a larger one ?	it's a little too loose , do you have one in a smaller size ?	do you have the hat in black ?
right over there .	yes , right over there against the wall .	in the fitting room , let me walk you over .	i have a hand mirror behind the counter .	yes , and why don't you take this one to try on as well .
does it suit me ?	this looks great .	do you have anything brighter ?	i don't see the mirror .	does this look too big for my head ?
yes , you look very nice .	i think it looks great !	try pulling it down more .	if you turn it around backwards it might look good too .	i think it looks great , are you going to get it ?
how much is it ?	let's try on another .	should i try on another ?	do you think i should get this same hat in blue ?	then it's settled . i'm buying this one !
we're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax .	it's on sale , 50 % off of it's original price !	that would be $ 15 .99 , miss .	we currently have a two for one sale going on right now if that helps ?	oh about $ 30 , but if you buy a second hat you get 30 % off the second one .
that's quite reasonable .	great ! i'll take it !	i'd like to see a few other options before i decide , please .	the price is so cheap , i'm worried about the quality of the item . do you have anything more high - end ?	do you have any other styles in red ?
what do you need to take it for ?	it depends . what do you need to drive for ?	you need 30 hours of behind the wheel training to be able to take the test .	can you tell me more information about the test you are taking ?	how many hours have you already spent behind the wheel ?
i'm trying to get my license .	i am applying to be a taxi driver	i need to know how many hours for a taxi field	i need a driving job , that's why .	need to see how many hours .
you need six hours .	you need to practice driving for at least 20 hours before trying to get your license .	you can be behind the wheel for as long you want .	please review the official driver handbook .	the test is easy , just practice for a few hours and you will be fine .
can i do all six hours in one day ?	that's not too bad .	thank you , i think i can do that .	that's more than i was expecting .	thank you for the information . is there anything else i should know ?
you have to do it in three days .	it can't be in one day	no , it has to be spread out .	you can do a max of 1 .5 hours per day .	it has to be spread over at least 4 days .
that's all i have to do ?	so i have to do two hours a day for three days ?	could i do three hours one day , one hour the next , and the last hour on the third day ?	do i have to do an equal amount of hours each day ?	do the hours need to be spread out evenly ?
that's everything .	no , you'll need to fill out these papers as well .	no . additional paperwork is required .	yes . we also need to take your photo .	yes , for the driving portion of the test .
well , that's a relief .	is there any paperwork i need to bring later ?	are there any other requirements about getting my license that i should know about ?	should i study the driving handbook ?	is there a test i need to take besides the practical driving test ?
i'm afraid so . we found this crack on the bottom when i went back to my hotel .	yes there is a crack	yes the top piece is chipped	yes i believe the vase is fake	is this a replica piece ?
oh , how awful ! let me have a look , i'm terribly sorry . it was most thoughtless of me . would you excuse me , please ?	would you like a replacement for the vase ?	would you like a refund ?	do you have a receipt for the vase ?	i will ask my manager to see what we could do for you .
oh , it's quite all right , i suppose . it can't be helped sometimes .	sure , that's not a problem .	yes , of course .	oh , of course , i'm not in a rush .	sure , that's ok .
it's very kind of you to say so . how about changing another one for you ?	i'll be right back with a new one .	thank you for understanding	unfortunately , not every customer sees it the same way .	i hope you know we will do what we can to make it up to you .
all right . thank you .	that would be great , can i send this one back	can i get the same vase instead ?	will you send this one in a better packaging ?	i look forward to getting the new vase .
just a minute , please . i won't be long . i'm sure this one is perfect . you may examine it carefully .	we don't have one exactly like this , but how about one with a red hue ?	i'm terribly sorry sir but we don't have a replica of this . what other vases do you like ?	is there any particular type of vase you would like ? i ask because we're all out of these .	here you go sir , a brand new vase . we've included a complimentary cushion case for it as well .
oh , yes , it is . i'll take this one .	the top is chipped though .	looks good , thank you very much .	it's beautiful , thanks for you help .	this won't cost me anything extra , right ?
i'm very sorry for any inconvenience i've caused you .	great , shall i wrap it up for you ?	wonderful . come over to the counter with me and i'll ring up the exchange .	i'm glad we could come to a resolution . let me put that in a bag for you .	would you like to purchase an extended warranty / damage policy for fifty dollars ? it will cover any future damages for the lifetime of the product .
well , there's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing .	thank you for letting me help you with this problem .	sometimes it is very easy for something to slip past us .	please feel free to let us know if we can help you with anything else .	i am terribly sorry you had to come back , would you like a complimentary cup of coffee ?
yes , we have some chinese medicine for common cold .	yes we do , what ailments do you have ?	yes , we have tea and oil of all kinds .	we do indeed . what ails you ?	we have medicine of all kinds . how can i help ?
i heard chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure .	what kind of medicine is it exactly ?	will this tradition chinese medicine really help ?	are there any side effects of the traditional chinese medicine that i should worry about >	how much is the traditional chinese medicine going to cost me ?
it depends . it's true that you can take some for prevention .	yes , many people believe that chinese medicine is healthier than going to a regular doctor .	yes , herbal chinese medicine is often more effective than taking pills prescribed by a doctor .	yes , some people believe that chinese medicine is better for you , though i've never seen any evidence of this that proves it .	yes , the chinese have perfected their traditional medicines over thousands of years .
i don't mind . i'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home .	how noisy ?	no not at all .	not if it's big enough .	yes i would mind .
good point . ok , let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us .	i prefer it to be quiet too .	it would be cheaper in a noisy area though .	let's try to find a quiet area then .	that's a good point , we will have to study too .
yes , if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early .	what time do you want to leave ?	do you want to drive ?	what day this week did you want to go ?	i will bring my mom with us to help .
how much do you think the rent will be ?	i agree . i think there will be a lot of people who miss out on a good flat .	being near the campus will make it easier without a car as well .	i would like a pool or gym nearby if possible .	we could have a common room for tv and guests .
i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month .	it will be $ 900/month .	it will be 1000 per month .	it will be 1100 per month .	it will be 1200 per month .
can you fill it ?	i need the cavity filled .	can you fill the cavity please ?	what can we do about the cavity ?	can you help me with this cavity ?
i'm afraid not . the tooth is too far gone . it'll have to be taken out .	let me take a closer look >	no . you will need a root canal .	let me look at the xrays first .	yes i can fill it today .
then i might as well have it done now .	will my insurance cover a tooth extraction ?	can you tell me how long that will take ?	could i maybe get a root canal and crown instead of having the tooth pulled ?	do you local nerve agents for the pain or can i be knocked out ?
you'd better wait , the gums are swollen . take the medicine i prescribe and come back in three days .	yes .	i agree .	that is right .	yes you should .
what do landlords charge for rent ?	i will ask around for you .	i think i know someone .	you can put an ad up at the college .	ask on your facebook , maybe someone knows somebody that is looking .
would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ?	yes , please visit www .zillow .com and they have multiple listings for apartments , the charges should be shown there as well .	i'm sure that the rent varies but we can easily look up and find this information .	a larger , less efficient apartment ranges about 1800 per month .	a small , 1 bedroom apartment is pretty reasonable .
there are two of us , but we only need a one - bedroom apartment .	i need it for two .	i need it for two people .	it is just me .	it is only for me .
you should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month .	let me show you some options then .	excellent , i have quite a few one - bedroom apartments .	and what is your price range ?	and how many bathrooms would you like ?
i really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me .	does that include utilities ?	ok , that works .	how much would it cost to post an advertisement ?	can you recommend a good location to look into ?
sure , i'll go look at apartments with you anytime you want .	okay . would you like to go this weekend ?	my work schedule is pretty tight for the next few weeks . can you wait a while or do you need to find something right away ?	i would love to look at apartments with you . when would you like to start ?	is there a particular area of the city that you like best to start looking ?
model of computers aren't compatible ?	what can i do to help with your overhead costs ?	the product will pay for itself very soon .	the benefits of this product outweigh the costs .	if you compare the price to others out there , it's not that much .
most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities .	exactly . the product requires the latest in computing technology .	yes , and most consumers don't have the additional money and resources to update their entire computer system .	yes , the product is only compatible with the latest computer models .	yes , the hardware and operating systems required for this product are brand new , and unfortunately it's not compatible with older systems .
maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable .	how can we remedy this ?	if we remove or hinder some capabilities will that help bring the price down ?	could we offer a rebate of some kind ?	what if we partner with a computer company and offer a package deal with newer , faster , more capable computers ?
but by then , the technology will be outdated .	true	i believe that	i think that is still too soon	that is what i believe
true , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge .	i would rather wait for new technology .	do you have any cheaper versions ?	how long do you think it might last ?	will the new technology be better and lower in price ?
that's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable .	i do not think spending the extra money is worth it .	let's see what the consumer says .	i will set up a demonstration .	i will send you a catalog of the product .
this model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it's a top - quality product .	see , we shoudln't worry about the cost	no one can offer what we can , so we have no competition .	what is something else that we can change ?	what are the consumers saying about the product ?
i guess you get what you pay for .	by the time we find a market , the technology may not be so advanced anymore .	the components are superior , but they raise the cost considerably .	i'm concerned that even top quality won't help us find a market , at this price point .	i supposed it's possible that it will find a niche in the high end market .
no , no . i've got plenty left .	yes , we have run out already .	no , there were none here when we arrived .	my daughter poured them into the bathtub .	there are some here but they look old and gross .
now i'm confused again ! what is the problem ?	then why are you asking for more ?	then how come you want to know how to get more ?	then there is no problem here	that is why i do not understand
what am i going to do about souvenirs ?	in case of need , how and where to approach for amenities ?	what is the procedure to get amenities ?	i might need more amenities in the future .	to make sure that i can get amenities when i need them ?
oh , i get it ! you want souvenirs !	we have a limit on how many we can give out .	i will send some up .	i will send up some soaps .	let me talk to my manager .
yes , i've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .	no , i need some more free amenities	yes , what can i get ?	what do you offer for free souvenirs ?	can i get anything for free ?
sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .	i can give you a couple of extra soaps .	i'm sorry , but my manager would not allow me to give you more soap than you could use during your stay .	i understand , for your convenience there is a gift shop in the lobby .	i understand , before you check out , please come down to the desk and request an extra soap .
please ! free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .	okay . i see . thank you .	how much of a discount do i get as a guest ?	would it still be possible for me to get just a few samples for free , as a guest ?	i've been a long - term guest and i think i deserve a few free souvenirs .
i understand completely , sir . housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .	the amenities you're talking about are meant for you to use in your room .	how many would you like ?	i'm sorry but you will need to visit our souvenir shop and purchase these items .	i would be happy to provide you with a few extra soaps .
what's the problem ?	sure . could you give me your name and account number ?	when was this check made ?	name and account number , please ?	absolutely .
i wrote the check out for way too much .	i do not have enough money in my account to cover the check	i put the wrong address on the check	my account has been hacked and i need to cancel all checks and cards	i put the wrong amount on the check
how much ?	i'm sorry , i can't do that .	sure , i'd be happy to cancel the check .	do you have the check number and the amount it was written for ?	how did that happen ?
i wrote the check out for $ 150 .	does the amount matter in order for me to cancel the check ?	is there a minimum or maximum amount that applies for my wanting to cancel the check ?	less than one hundred dollars .	more than one hundred dollars too much .
what were you supposed to write it out for ?	there will be a charge to cancel your check .	yes , i can help you cancel that check .	i would be happy to help you with this .	i can not cancel this check because it has already been cashed .
i was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 .	i should've written the check for $ 100 .	i meant to write the check out for $ 100 .	i was supposed to write it out for $ 100 .	the total amount should have been $ 100 .
i'll just cancel it for you right now .	could you give me your account number ?	i hate it when that happens !	do you know the check number ?	who is the check made out to ?
that's great . you're a lifesaver .	thank you !	is there a charge to cancel it ?	can i also get cash out of my account ?	how long will it take to get the cancel in the system ?
the suitcase , that's all . except my handbag . of course .	no , just carry on .	yes , i'd like to check two bags please .	i would prefer to take both of my bags on board with me .	how much can i carry with me on the plane ?
would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? you needn't weigh your handbag .	very good . you can check your suitcase and carry your handbag on the plane .	you might be able to stow that suitcase in the overhead bin . we should measure it .	that's fine . it would be a good idea to check in now .	they will be able to take care of you at the desk then . have a good flight .
is there a receipt ?	where is the scale ?	what is the weight limit ?	what is the weight limit ?	i can not lift the suitcase .
yes . i'll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket .	yes , i will give you the receipt right after weighing the luggage .	no , there will be no receipt for your luggage , but a luggage tag .	of course , you will be given the receipt .	this luggage tag will replace the receipt .
what must i do next ?	is my flight boarding yet ?	what's the weather like in london ?	is my flight on - time ?	is there any way i can carry it on ?
you must go to immigration to the departure lounge .	you need to walk down the hall and go through security .	you have two hours before your flight . you can get lunch before you have to board .	you will have to take the stuff out of your pockets and open your handbag to get through security .	you will have to wait for them to call your flight . there are restaurants , bathrooms and shopping areas to fill your time .
don't you have the exams coming up soon ? i'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those .	you always say that .	you can't be falling asleep in class anymore .	no excuses , to with you !	you need to get back on schedule .
oh , i nearly forgot the exams .	yes i do . i will study for another hour .	i've spent the evening studying . i just want to watch a little television and then go to bed .	my exams are in two weeks . we are getting study guides tomorrow .	i wrote my essay tonight . i just want to listen to music and relax .
you do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . am i right ?	yeah , that's what i thought , mister .	you need a good night's sleep to do well for the exams	you need to limit your tv watching until after those exams .	you need to get to bed , no more tv tonight .
yeah , i guess so . maybe i can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow .	you're right , mum . i guess i'll go to bed .	if i promise to do better can i stay up longer , mum ?	but mum , i'm not tired . i don't want to go to bed .	just 10 more minutes , mum . please ?
an excellent idea . work now and play later .	that's a good girl .	how mature of you .	go on .	that's what i wanted to hear .
i know you're right . school is more important than tv . can i watch one more show , then go to bed .	alright , you win . i guess i'm going to go get ready for bed then . goodnight !	i'm going to set my alarm for 6 am so that i can have about a half hour to study the material before i go to school .	just let me stay up for 10 more minutes and then i promise that i'll go right to bed !	well , alright . i'm going to go and brush my teeth and change into my pajamas then .
no , now it's bedtime .	you heard me . time for bed now .	alright , one more show , but then straight to bed .	not tonight . get ready for bed now .	maybe just one , and only tonight . but then you must get ready for bed .
last week , madam ? i really can't remember which ones you mean . what were they like ?	were they the stainless steel or the telflon saucepans ?	were you interested in the pan set or was there a specific size of saucepan you were looking for ?	they came in many different colors . was there a specific color you were looking for ?	there were several types last week . we only have the blue set of saucepans left . would you like to see them ?
oh , they were lovely . sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country - style you know , and the lids , if i remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ?	they looked like the ceramic ones .	how many saucepans did you have in your window last week ?	the set on sale for $ 100	they were teflon with a red exterior .
that's strange . i don't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . are you sure they were in this shop ?	i believe i may know the sauce pans to which you are referring . can you elaborate a little more ?	i apologize , madam , but i can not recall this particular saucepan . do you recall the brand ?	well , madam , the particular saucepan may be different depending on whether it was a leaf pattern or a flower pattern . can you be more descriptive ?	these saucepans sound familiar . madam , can you provide any further details ?
oh , you must know the ones i mean . they were on sale , a real bargain . reduced to a quarter of the original price . i couldn't believe my eyes when i saw them .	yes , i'm sure .	i am absolutely certain .	yes , i am neurotic about these things .	i'm pretty sure there aren't any similar stores around here .
i am afraid the sales are over now , madam . and you know we all sold out of the saucepans .	i see . if you wait just one moment , i will ask another employee if they recalled seeing the pans you were talking about last week .	it's a possibility that we had these pans and they sold out quickly since they were on special . i can check the stockroom for you , but i don't believe we have any more left on the sales floor .	oh , i do remember the ones you're referring to now ! unfortunately , we did sell out of them last weekend . . . we have some similar pans over here though , if you're interested !	i'm very sorry , but i don't recall the set that you're referring to . we do have some other cookware that is one sale at the moment , if you'd like me to show you what we have in stock .
i don't think you did , you know . my neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday .	oh , are you certain ? there were a number of them available last week . they were just beautiful .	would you mind checking in the back to verify ? surely they must still be here .	would you perhaps be able to locate them in another location ?	such a pity . they were so lovely . are you certain you would not be able to possibly locate any ?
well , it's all new stock in the window now .	i believe your neighbor may be mistaken , madam .	i'm sorry , but if they were here yesterday , they aren't here today .	perhaps there's another item i could interest you in ?	there's another shop like this a block away . perhaps you're thinking of them .
may i just have a look , to see if there is anything else ?	i can see that . i'm interested in the pans from last week .	would you check in the back to see if you still have the ones from last week ?	where did the pans go from yesterday ?	was anyone else working in the store last week who would remember the saucepans ?
eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing .	sure , come right in .	yes , i will check in the back as well for you .	let me ask the other girl here to see if she remembers them .	our other pans are in the back corner if you'd like to check them out .
yes , yes , i am sorry i won't keep you . it must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . but they were such beautiful saucepans . i'd have bought them if i had made up my mind on the spot .	okay , well what time is the shop open tomorrow ?	bummer , i really wanted to take a look at it right now .	that's right the shop is closing soon , my apologies !	is it possible to have the shop open just a little bit longer while i take a look ?
perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , i could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . and there are still one or two things at the sale price .	you can take a look tomorrow morning when we open .	if you are nearby , i'll let you take a look really quick while i finish closing up the rest of the shop .	if you come early tomorrow , you'll be able to take a look before anybody else buys one .	i'll tell you what , if you are in the area , i'll let you take a quick look . i have to do some paperwork and won't leave right at closing time .
oh , look ! that was the one there . that is the sort of thing i was looking for . but it's not quite the color .	i have a hair appointment in the area , i'll drop by after that .	i'd really appreciate that , it's so kind of you .	i'll do that , see you tomorrow .	see you in the morning , thanks a bunch .
that might be the artificial lighting , madam . of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it's exactly what you are looking for .	let me know the color and i'll call you about it tomorrow .	i'm sorry but there isn't time to check now but i'll check first thing tomorrow .	i will be more than happy to help you with this another day .	give me your details and i'll contact you about the product tomorrow .
there it is . that is the pattern ! the set behind you . thank goodness , they haven't been sold . and thank you so much for being so patient with me . yes , those are the ones .	oh , i know what you mean about the lighting . i'm sure it's fine .	yes , perhaps you're right . but do you have any more of this model in back ?	tomorrow they might be gone altogether .	oh , don't you worry . this should be over in a flash .
i am afraid i can't agree with you there . i must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies .	i think i will check some other places . thank you .	can i get a discount on such a large order ?	i think you're high - balling me . can we meet to discuss a counter - offer ?	i suppose you're right . let's do the order , but without the ornaments .
but you must take the design and quality into consideration . you know we are superior to others in design and quality . we have various styles , which the other companies can not catch up with .	may we see the prices of these competitors ? perhaps we can match them .	we can not speak on behalf of our competitors , but i assure you our prices are competitive and fair .	do these other companies offer the same standards of service that we provide ?	we are always willing to negotiate when able . may we ask which competitors you are referring to ?
i agree that yours are of the top .	i'm willing to work out something if we can agree on a price .	i'm sorry , but i will find a different company for this business deal .	can we talk about a different price quote ?	if you don't want to work out a lower price , then i will cancel this deal .
well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ?	we take the quality of our products offered very seriously and as such , that does make them a bit more expensive than other companies . despite this , many of the various styles that we carry are exclusive to our company alone as a result .	i am sorry to hear that you find our prices to be a little high . where our prices are higher however , we more than make up for with both innovation and customer service .	thank you for recognizing the quality of our items . please take your time thinking our transaction over and i will be happy to assist you further when you have made your decision .	i appreciate your feedback . i will try to talk to my supervisor and see if there is anything that can be done to lower the cost of your shipment . your patience and understanding is greatly appreciated .
to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 % would help .	of what ? the size of my order ?	my order will likely be in the range of several dozen boxes .	roughly several dozen boxes , and possibly more for a bulk discount .	that largely depends on how much we are able to negotiate on pricing .
impossible . how about 5 % off ?	i'm afraid that's a little too much . how about 5 % ?	i can do that if you're willing to double your order .	if you're willing to commit to a recurring order , perhaps we can do that .	if you'd like , you can check with other suppliers and then get back to us .
right . a reduction of 5 % is acceptable .	that is too low . i can only agree at a 10 % reduction .	5 % off sounds fair . thank you , i'd like to place the order .	could you split the difference and do a 7 % discount ?	great , thank you . let's place the order now .
economy or business class ?	i do apologize , but we can not offer a one - year open return on such a ticket . the most that i am able to do is one month . please let me know if this is alright .	i'm very sorry , but we are unable to offer a one - year open return on your ticket . our policy clearly states that the maximum amount of time for any returns is one month in advance .	so i have one round trip ticked with a one - year return ? i've sent your order to be processed . is there anything else i can assist you with today ?	would you like to upgrade your seat to first class for an additional $ 70 ?
economy , please . how much is it ?	economy , please .	business class , thanks .	what is the difference in price ?	that depends . tell me the difference in price and what each includes .
it will be $ 850 .	it's $ 500 .	it depends on which seat you'd like . window , aisle , or middle ?	it's $ 500 , but if you're willing to travel on another day , we can probably get it cheaper .	it's $ 500 , but if you fly through san francisco you can get a cheaper fare .
very good . could i get an electronic ticket ? i'm always afraid of losing my tickets .	okay , i would like to pay using my visa credit card .	i was hoping it would be less expensive ; is there any way to decrease the cost ?	would it be any cheaper if i travelled on a different day ?	i would like to know the terms if i need to change the day i fly or cancel my trip .
no problem . how do you wish to pay for it ?	yes we can do that .	of course you can .	sorry we don't offer that .	they do not sell electronic ones .
bank of american card . the number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 .	i would like to pay it with my credit card please .	would it be possible to pay with my credit card ?	i wish to pay using my credit card so let me know when you're ready so i can provide you with my credit card information .	is there any offers of financing by any chance ?
thank you ! would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ?	thank you !	thank you , give me a second while i enter the numbers .	very well , and what is the expiration date ?	may i also have the 3-digit security number ?
an aisle seat , please . i'm tall and need to get up and walk pretty often .	i want a window seat .	i want an aisle seat .	i don't have a preference .	i want a window seat unless it's next to the wing .
no problem . your ticket is for trans pacific flight 87 from detroit to beijing at 3 forty p . m . on april 13 . you will arrive at beijing international airport at six 35 p . m . on april 14 . your electronic	great , i have that booked for you .	do you have a meal requirement ?	do you mind the exit row ?	is a bulkhead row to your liking ?
what time should i arrive at detroit airport ?	pardon ? i think your message cut off there .	sorry ; my electronic what , my ticket ? your message ended abruptly .	could you repeat that , please ?	hello ? sorry , i think i missed half your message .
please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . you also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure .	arriving at 3 pm would be a good bet	arrive no later than 3 pm	i would come a hour be fore your flight	at least a hour before your flight
what happens if i can't leave on april 13 ? can i cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ?	do i need to bring more than just a passport for i d ?	do i have to go to the ticket counter to confirm when i get there ?	do i need to call to reconfirm the departure ?	can i confirm the reservation online ?
yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation .	you can change your reservation if it's at least 7 days before date of travel .	you can change your reservation up to 7 days before departure but you may pay a higher fee .	i'm sorry , there are no changes allowed to the departure date on an economy class ticket .	you can cancel or change the reservation if it's more than 7 days in advance . there will be a re - ticketing fee .
that's ok . what are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ?	ok that seems fair . thank you for the information .	that's a high price ! has your policy always been like that ?	that is good to know , i will make sure i finalize my plans before the cancellation or change penalty kicks in .	are there any ways around that fee if an emergency pops up ?
on trans pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds .	up to 50 pounds	there are no restrictions with this ticket .	up to 50 pounds , but if you book a business class ticket there is no restriction .	up to 25 pounds is free . anything over 25 pounds is an additional $ 25 .
that's great ! i can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . i think i'm all set . you're really efficient . thank you very much for your help .	perfect ! i like to travel with plenty of extra clothes as the weather changes often .	wonderful , that will accommodate my needs perfectly .	what is the charge for an overweight bag ?	what is the charge for an extra bag ?
thank you for the compliment and for calling g . o . t . travel agency . have a nice trip !	no problem !	you're welcome .	anytime .	enjoy your trip .
ok , i will get one for your . here you are .	yes i like the color brown too .	of course , i am sure if you try it on you will love it .	certainly , here you go try it on .	the color brown is a pretty unique color .
but it is too loose . do you have the smaller size ?	thank you .	thank you , i'll go change really quick .	thanks , give me a second while i try this one on .	thank you , but this is the wrong size .
sorry , it had been sold out .	certainly , let me get a couple of sizes smaller .	no , i'm afraid that one is the smallest .	the sides are adjustable to make fitting perfect .	here is the next size down .
what a pity !	oh well i'll take this one then .	this one will work out .	i'll just tighten the brown one then .	do you have one in a different color ?
what's the current interest rate ?	sounds good !	i always try to keep it high for instances like these .	thank you !	i do my best to keep my credit rating good .
our monthly interest is 1 . 5 % of the outstanding balance . would you please fill out the application the form ?	with your credit score , i think i can keep it low . let me do some calculations .	depending on how you set the loan up , it can be as low as 4 percent .	it's generally going to be around 6 percent .	it's 5 percent but if you choose to have the payments drafted , it will be 4 .5 .
model it for me .	i can't wait to give it to him for his birthday .	i hope it'll make him laugh .	my mom will roll her eyes when she sees it .	he doesn't really need another tie but i'm getting it anyway .
ok !	tada ! what do you think ?	does it look better like this or this ?	how does it look ?	does this make me look fat ?
wow ! you look just as dorky as dilbert !	but , keep the rest of your clothes on this time .	i meant the tie . you can stand upright again .	yes , that's exactly what dilbert looks like . good job .	i meant on your neck .
a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle .	it's where the money can come directly from your bank account .	it's a way to pay without having to come in to the branch .	it's an online service we offer to pay your bill .	it's a handy alternative where the money is debited automatically each month .
but how will you know how much i should pay ? i mean , i receive my bills , not you .	i'm not sure i'm comfortable with that . what happens if the bill is wrong ?	will i still get a bill in the mail ?	tell me more about how that works .	well , i don't know . maybe i'll just keep driving to your branch .
we set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .	the utility company will charge the account the exact amount of your bill .	the utility company handles how much is being charged . have you never used direct debit service before ?	the utility company charges your account the amount of your bill and it just comes out of your checking account . you can still log in and see the amount taken out to make sure it is correct .	the amount charged is all taken care of by the utility company .
i see . so , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? that does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free .	that would be great !	how do i get that set up ?	what if i don't have enough money in my account ?	are there any bills i can't pay this way ?
sure . what's your number , please .	sure . does she have your number ?	i'm not sure when she'll be back . how late is the office open ?	i'll give her the message . can you tell me your name again please ?	right . i'll do that .
519 367 8901 .	she has my number already i gave it to her last week .	yes it is 1 - 800 - 256 - 4250 thank you .	actually i will just try calling her back tomorrow thank you .	yes 308 - 641 - 2414 . thank you .
thanks . and your name is tony , right ?	thanks . i'll have her call .	thank you .	i'll let her know when she gets in .	when is too late to call back ?
yes . i'm tony . thank you very much .	yes my name is tony .	that is correct .	that's right .	indeed my name is tony .
you're welcome . bye .	you're welcome .	anytime !	no problem .	talk to you later .
bye .	actually could you tell me if you know when lily will be in ? maybe i'll just call back	before you go , do you know why lily is not in right now ? i thought she was there today	actually , before you go , could you take a message to give to her ?	sorry , before you hang up , do you happen to know lily's email ? i may try reaching her that way as well .
i bought it for one hundred and forty - five dollars at helen's boutique . i didn't know i could get it cheaper somewhere else .	i paid $ 500 ! i am really upset right now !	i paid $ 250 ! i can't believe it i feel like they ripped me off now .	i got it for $ 50 . i wonder if they made a mistake on the pricing .	it was $ 200 . i am going to have to go back tomorrow and see why they charged me so much !
of course ! everything at helen's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why didn't you shop around ?	do you still have your receipt ?	maybe you can return it and buy it at maxine's ?	that's a shame . helen's always over charges .	oh yeah , maxine's always has decent prices .
i don't know , i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it . i guess i was too impulsive .	that's a good idea .	i should shop around .	thanks i will do that .	i will definitely next time .
that's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably .	this is very true , and very apparent in today's market .	agreed . cars are a great example of this .	absolutely . do you have experience with this type of market ?	indeed . are you familiar with exports and marketability ?
yes , sometimes the differences are great .	yes that is true , every country is different .	do they have to adjust it for every different country ?	yes i am sure they do , it must be difficult .	it is crazy how we are all so similar but also different .
well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product .	exporters who don't take these things into consideration stand to lose a lot of money .	exporters who take these things into account do very well .	exporters who are not conscious of the needs of their customers will fail .	exporters need to be very in tune with the changing needs of their customers overseas .
we have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales .	yes , or it will be a failed exportation	definitely ! why waste money and trying to export something the other country won't buy	maybe we can take advantage of the difference and it may help the exporters make more money .	you are right .
thanks a lot .	which window , the one on the right or the left ?	ok thank you i will head to that window .	do the guides cost any money ?	are you sure you do nt have any lying around ?
oh , yes . how old are you ?	what are your plans while you are in the city ?	how can i help you today ?	ah yes , our bus service is exceptional .	how can i help make your visit better ?

what subjects are you studying ?	really ? what university do you go to ?	nice ! so you're a junior this year , so are you graduating next year ?	economics is a tough major . what made you choose majoring in economics ?	a degree in economics is really good . what do you plan to do after you graduate ?

okay . mr . liu , we'll inform you of the results within a week .	are you good with working with other people ?	what other computer skills do you have ?	are you proficient with microsoft office ?	where do you see yourself in 5 years ?
what style do you want ?	i think that one looked good on you , maybe you should try something " abnormal " this time .	i think we may just need to pick one out .	ok . . . let me know what you are looking for and maybe i can also help you find it .	let's go home and shop online ! i think it is much easier and more choices .
i want to buy a v - neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .	minimalist style	something with warm colors to match the season .	something more casual	vintage seems to work for me .
oh , i see . how about the color ?	maybe we need to try a different store .	you know they don't really have that much to chose from .	maybe we should just stop for the day and go to lunch ?	they don't have much i like either . these styles now days .
quiet color .	i want the checked sweater to be black and white .	i don't really care about the color .	what color do you think i should get ? what color goes well with my complexion ?	well i'm thinking about the colors blue or red . which do you prefer ?
i know a shop selling this kind of sweaters .	i'n not sure you can find any checkered anything that isn't loud	what do you consider a quiet color ?	how big do you want the checkers to be ?	are you sure you want checkers " ? '
really ? let's go there .	great could you let me know the name and i'll check it out !	what's the shop name ? i'll see if i have time to go today .	could you give me the name ? i'll go look at the sweaters there .	what's the store's name ? i'll go check it out !
i didn't know you were a vegetarian !	they have a really good salad bar and also a buffet with lots of great vegetables .	if you like we can go somewhere else , i'm game for anything . i can have a steak another time .	hey , i've heard of a vegetarian place that's just opened . some friends of mine say it's great . would you like to give it a try ?	how about us get chinese , they have lots of great vegetarian options and i love their walnut chicken .
i'm not , i am a vegan .	yes , i just started a year ago .	yes , i want to make a difference in the world and being a vegetarian is one way for me to contribute .	yes , i want to fight for the rights of animals and be a vegetarian is one way to start .	i am . my significant other is a great vegetarian chef , and i'm hooked . i don't need to eat meat anymore .
a what ?	oh i'm sorry . i always get them mixed up	what is it you do not eat again . i always get confused .	i'm sorry that is what i meant	i'm sorry . do you have any spots in mind ? i'/m pretty flexible
a vegan . i don't eat or use any animal based products . i don't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you don't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood .	a vegan ! i don't eat meat , eggs or dairy !	i'm a vegan . i don	i'm a vegan i don't eat meat or use animal products .	i follow a vegan diet . i don't eat meat and don't use animal products like leather .
wow ! that's interesting ! it must be tough !	when did you stop eating meat ?	it must be difficult to eat out .	where do you find nice shoes that aren't made of leather ?	let's look for a place that has vegan options .
it's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it's getting a bit less difficult .	it can be at times . but i make it work .	it often is because people judge me for it .	it's not so difficult once you get used to it .	it's not too bad and it makes me feel better to help out our animal friends .
did you think that the food was any good ?	sloppy service or sloppy food ?	why do you say that ?	yeah ? but how was the food ?	do you think the kids would enjoy it ?
i wasn't all that impressed by the food .	it could have been better . some of the food came out cold !	i was a bit disappointed . they mixed up some of our orders too !	maybe it was because they had opened recently ? some of our orders were really behind .	i was expecting better . i'm not sure if i'll go back
the service certainly could have been better .	what didn't you like about it ?	did you dislike all of it ? was anything good ?	how was the wine ?	why didn't you send it back ?
the service did not help the situation .	i don't think they had enough waitresses .	it's true . it took a long time for our food to come .	the service was the best part , which isn't saying much .	and their cleaning staff could have been better , too .
is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ?	that is too bad .	i am sorry .	sorry about that .	i am sorry about that .
i am not interested in trying this restaurant again .	no , not if it's like this again .	only if the drastically improve !	no thank you .	sure , if they get their act together .

wouldn't the owners have told me about any problems ?	oh , thanks !	great , so did you find anything ?	okay , could you tell me what you found ?	so are there any surprises ?
sellers aren't always truthful , and there might also be problems that they aren't aware of .	home owners like to assume everything is fine , but they don't search as thoroughly as i do .	you'd like to think so , but you'd be surprise what kinds of issue people forget to mention .	i'm an expert at finding issues inside homes . the average home owner ? not so much .	the insurance company requires a licensed inspector to go through the home before they'll consider giving you a policy .
can i require the owners to fix the problems ?	did you find anything wrong with the house ?	was there any black mold anywhere ?	were there any leaks in the foundation ?	is the home clear to be moved into ?
you can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems .	if the owners still own the house , you should speak to them .	you can take them to court .	maybe they don't realize there are problems and would appreciate you letting them know .	yes .
what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ?	ok , thanks for letting me know .	they will fix the problems ?	why aren't they truthful ?	ok , thank you .
there were no major problems . one leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that i found .	that it was dirty	that your home is worthless	that you should not buy that home	that that home has serious problems

that will do . what an interesting picture ! how old is it ?	that works fine .	as long as it's still valid .	as long as there's a photo on it .	sure , of course it does .
actually it wad taken just last year , but i had a shaved head and a beard . can you still recognize me ?	that photo is at least two years old .	my photo is about two years old .	i think it was taken about two years ago .	my last photo was taken about two years ago .
barely . will you be checking any luggage today ?	i don't know . let me hold it beside you .	that certainly made quite a difference in your appearance .	my uncle did the same thing and no one recognized him .	your features are still discernible behind your beard .
yes , one suitcase . i also have a carry - on bag .	i will be checking two bags , please .	i have many bags and they are here beside me .	no , i have only this carry on bag with me .	no , i plan on purchasing new clothes when i get to my destination .
ok . mr . lee , you're all set . your flight leaves from gate 10 . boarding begins at 10:30	that is not a problem with your ticket upgrade .	are you bringing any liquids with you ?	do you have any weapons or sharp objects in the bags ?	put the suitcase on the conveyor belt , please .
you're right . too much or too little won't do any good .	it's hard to get exercise with such a busy schedule .	i can see the exercise is really working for you , i should try it .	i need to exercise more but can't find the time .	i wish i could find more time to exercise .
the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet .	they've got great equipment and that helps a lot .	i keep to a schedule and that really helps order my life .	they've got some great personal trainers there and that makes a difference .	why don't you come with me and we'll work out together ?
sounds reasonable .	my diet is another thing i need to work on .	i've heard that you have to feed your muscle .	it's so hard to eat right and go to the gym when you have a career .	what kinds of things should i be eating ?
we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .	i have to eat more protein and less simple carbs .	i set up an appointment with the club nutritionist .	i've been trying to eat more fruits and vegetables .	i think so too , so i'm starting a new diet .
and fruits !	that makes sense .	yeah , junk food makes you feel good in the moment but bad afterwards .	junk food also interferes with the results of working out .	but i don't like vegetables . . .
surely it is . getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness .	you're right !	yes , exactly . balance is key .	mmm , i could go for a good grapefruit right now !	it's important to have a high fiber diet as well .
i've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ?	i know the importance of sleep	most people do not know the importance of sleep	it sure is	i agree with that
yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can also help one to keep sound physical health .	yes he does . getting adequate sleep is key .	you should also cut down on carbs	and get 5 fruits and vegetables a day . color variety is best	finally , try toneat fish and minimize red meat
i think if you follow your trainer's advice , you'll be on the right track .	what else does he tell you about staying fit ?	that's cool , what kind of exercises does he tell you about ?	does your trainer send you home with any homework ?	how does being in a good mood help you stay fit ?
you bet it !	thank you , me too .	i sure hope so !	thanks , you can join me whenever .	as long as i put in the effort .
then i'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc .	what type of manufactures warranty is available for the flying pigeon bicycles ?	are individual bike parts available for resale in bulk ?	the quality and a reasonable price point will be a major attraction with our customer base .	how long has the flying pigeon brand been available for resale in this competitive bike market ?

how much must i pay ?	alrgight .	that is fine .	that is no big deal .	that is no problem .
it's ten yuan .	it will be $ 25 for the overage .	if you have a heavy sweater in there , i would take it out and carry it onboard .	the overage is $ 5 per pound so it will be $ 10 .	is there something that you could do to lighten it just a little ?
here you are .	oh , ok . that's reasonable .	ok , here you go .	ok , do you need my credit card ?	ten yuan seems high for two pound , but i guess i don't have an option .
this is your luggage check which you must show when you disembark at your destination and here is your boarding pass and your ticket .	thank you .	here is your change .	is there anything else ?	have a good flight .
thanks .	who do i show the luggage check to ?	will i be able to keep my carry - on luggage with me , even though it's too heavy ?	can i get a receipt for the ten yuan ?	is it usual to weigh carry - on luggage ?
now , please wait until your flight is called . there's about twenty - five minutes to go .	no problem	your welcome	okay	sure
i'm a little nervous . i've never flown before .	do you know if the flight is on time ?	where is the boarding entrance ?	can you direct me to the nearest restrooms ?	is there a lounge that i can wait in ?
there's nothing at all to worry about . once you are in the air , it's just like sitting at your sitting room . it's going to be a very pleasant flight .	should i fear turbulence ?	what is the duration of the flight	will there be snacks surveyed on the flight	when can i pick up my luggage ?
there is no need . thanks .	i refuse to wait another ten minutes for a seat .	i have been waiting long enough for a seat . it's not my fault you lost the reservation .	i don't want any window seat . i would like that specific window seat .	that's fine , but only if it's 10 minutes .

it might begin now .	i heard the chinese team is pretty good .	i've never watched a chinese team play basketball before .	i'd rather watch basketball than listen to the radio .	this should be an exciting game .
can i send it in now ?	you're right , i'll be more careful .	is it ok to go ahead and send it now ?	is there a way i can do the claim form online ?	how long will it take to get paid if i send it in now ?

can i mail it in early next time so it isn't late ?	ok , i will check .	you mean i will not get paid ?	where do i send it ?	can i bring it in ?
actually , you can not mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date .	you can send it in up to a week early , but not earlier than that .	i'm sorry , but you can only send it in on the due date .	yes , but you'll still get your money on the same date .	yes , that's no problem .

all right , mr . cook . i'll have mr . baker call you back as soon as he gets here .	we will relay the message .	is there a number he should try to reach you at ?	certainly mr cook .	should i tell him what this is in regards to ?
and when do you get home at night ?	when does work end ?	that must be nice .	i'd love to sleep in , but i do like finishing work by 5 .	do you have to stay at work late then ?
i get home pretty late , around midnight .	i'm usually out the door by eleven , and i only live a few minutes away .	it depends on how busy we are . i'm usually home before midnight , but if we get a last minute rush , i'll stay late and help out with closing .	i'm almost always home by eleven thirty or so .	i usually get home before midnight .
so what do you do , exactly ?	oh wow ! that's a late shift !	do you ever get concerned about coming home so late from work ?	that's pretty late ! i don't think i would like that shift .	do you stay up late even when you're not working ?
i'm a tv announcer . don't you recognize me ? i do the weather report on knt !	i work in a factory that makes car parts .	i work in a bakery .	i work at a newspaper .	i work at a radio station as a dj .

like what ?	what happens now ?	how long were you in there ?	when do you think you'll hear back from them ?	maybe you should talk to a lawyer before you talk to them again .
oh , he wanted to know what time i got up this morning and if i bad a bath or a shower you know , things like that .	like " what were you doing this morning ? " .	i'm really concerned as i was out on the deck all morning , but no one was with me .	they asked to see my receipt from my purchases this morning . this is very insulting !	they wanted to know where i was this morning when the items disappeared . this is extremely frustrating !
what on earth has that got to do with some money disappearing ?	what else did he want to know ?	well , did you , take the shower ?	did you answer them ?	how long did they question you ?
i've no idea . oh yes , and the most ridiculous thing . he asked me what i had for breakfast this morning .	right ?	you have to wonder	it was nonsence	i don't know
oh well , that's it . they obviously think you're a desperate criminal and you have to steal to eat . i should think you'll get thirty years .	that is such a weird question to ask	why would he have to ask something like that ?	i would not think they would have to know that	what does breakfast have to do with anything ?
hmm . thank you very much .	or , maybe life .	yes , i'm hungry .	i told them i had ham and eggs for breakfast .	they really ganged up on me .
i see , sir . this one is very good .	does he have any allergies ?	do you have any preferred brands ?	how much milk powder did you need ?	did you want the product delivered , or were you planning to pick it up ?

you may rest assured . it sells well .	yes this milk powder is great for children	yes this is one of our best	yes your son will enjoy it	yes it is a best seller
may i have a look at the introduction ?	is it good on the quality ?	are there any other options for this product around ?	what is the milk made from ?	are there any added ingredients in the milk powder ?

yes , it is . sayuri beds , tokyo , japan .	please	yes , you are right .	that's it exactly	correct

i don't want anything except a taxi , thank you .	no , i'll stick to a taxi .	just a taxi please .	that seems out of my price range .	a taxi would work out better .

which do you prefer ?	how much does it cost ?	how do i use it ?	does it have any side effects ?	is it difficult to apply ?
hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer .	oh i'm partial to my grandmothers remedy but this one is good .	i think the lotion is a little easier to apply . the cream you kinda have to rub in	the cream smells a lot better but they are equally effective	they are basically the same but there's a coupon for the lotion this week
is there anything else i can do to help with the itching ?	then let's go with that .	i'll take the cream then .	i want the cream .	thanks , cream sounds good .
you can take an antihistamine .	wash the affected area and try to keep it clean .	keep the area clean and then cover it up with a bandage or something .	rub some aloe cream on it .	not much , sorry .
thank you so much for all of the information .	is that dangerous ?	what are the side effects ?	where can i acquire such a thing ?	how much does that cost ?
you are welcome . please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help .	anytime .	of course .	your welcome !	let me know if you have any more questions .

i'm akimbo . nice to meet you , i guess .	you must have been the mechanic that worked on it last week !	hi hal !	how do you know my car ?	so where did you see my car a couple weeks ago ?
boy , i'm sure sorry about your car . hey , akimbo , i wonder if you'd like to make a deal ?	you wouldn't believe what happened when i saw this car a few weeks back , hal . wow !	wow . i never thought i'd see this car , again . what a crazy time .	well , hal , you have some car on your hands . let me tell you .	hal , this car is something else .

as a new - comer , you usually have five days of annual vacation . and remember you have to fill out a request form , if you want to ask for leave .	we get two weeks paid vacation .	it depends on what you negotiated when you were hired , typically you get one paid week in your first year .	you do get vacation time , but it depends how long you've been working here and in what position .	we get great vacation benefits .
will our company have some recreational activities ?	ok that sounds reasonable	that sounds unfair	ok that is good	that makes sense
of course . in spring and autumn , we will hold some sports actives . and in movie seasons , we bulk purchase film tickets .	yes , we have an indoor gym .	yes , we have an indoor swimming pool .	yes , we do party games every month as a teamwork activity !	you can take advantage of our indoor gym and swimming pool .

it's my rock bottom price . take it or leave it .	the scarf is $ 15 . you can purchase both for $ 75 .	i'm sorry , i'm not allowed to modify the sale price .	ok , sounds good !	75 $ and it's a deal !
when you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . you will get monthly pay and will be on eight - hour / day work shift .	and you are fine with that ?	and after that the pay is $ 10 an hour .	once the internship is up you are a full associate .	do you understand the requirements of the internship ?
wait , will i have five insurances and one fund ?	great !	i can't wait !	that sounds fair .	ok , i can live with that !
yes . you can also enjoy legal holidays and year - end bonus .	all insurances are separate entities .	insurances are paid for in part by the employee and the employer .	i'm unsure as to what you mean . one fund ?	insurance premiums are unique to their respective plans .
it sounds great !	thanks for going over this with me .	got it .	i'm ready to sign .	how is the bonus calculated ?
if you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .	see you soon !	look forward to having you here .	any other questions ?	i m sure you'll love it !

you have read the relevant terms of the contract . do you have other questions ?	so when can you start ?	so when are available ?	so does it sound good ?	yes ?
how long will the induction training be ?	not at the moment , thank you .	what are the people like that i will be working with ?	what is the office dress code ?	what is the sick day policy ?
about two weeks .	induction training will be covered in the three month internship .	we do not require induction training because all of that is covered in the internship .	the induction training period is two weeks .	induction training is typically two weeks to a month , though depending on how well you perform in your internship , it may not be necessary .
i see .	that is a long time	that is a short time	that sounds fair	i will do the two weeks
if you don't have other questions , just sign here .	will that be a problem ?	does that work for you ?	you'll learn everything you need to know .	we like to be thorough at our company .
ok .	i am looking forward to working with you john .	i really appreciate you taking time to go over this with me .	that's a fairly easy process .	it was really nice to meet you john .
can i get you anything to drink ? :	what kind of dressing would you like ?	great , i will bring it right out !	would like that with your meal or before ?	are you sure i can't interest you in soup ?
yes , i'd like a glass of iced tea .	what flavors of tea do you have ?	a water with lime for now , and may i please see your wine list ?	a ginger ale for the time being . may i see your spirits menu ?	a coffee , black - no - sugar , please .

thank you .	thank you so much .	can i get a lemon slice for my tea ?	no straw with the tea please .	would i be able to get the dressing on the side ?
i'll get the flour out .	meet me in the kitchen when you are done .	i will start getting stuff ready .	i will start getting stuff ready .	i will help you/
let me help you .	i'll get the sugar !	can i get the milk and eggs ?	i'll get the cookie cutters . we can make heart - shaped cookies .	don't start without me !
then what's your counter - offer ?	i truly want us to come to a mutual agreement in terms of pricing . what figure did you have in mind ?	i apologize , sir , but this is the best we can do without cutting into a small profit margin .	this seems a bit drastic . let's revisit the figures .	i'm afraid there is nothing further that we can do , sir .
this is our counter - offer .	we were hoping for closer to 10 % .	5 % . take it or leave it .	we really can't go beyond 5 % .	5 % ?
we are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter - offer and our price is too great .	fine have a nice day .	alright ill see what i can do .	thanks for your time .	let me talk to my supervisor and get back to you .
so are we . our counter - offer is in line with the world market .	we can't change the figures anymore	it's really the best we can give .	let me ask the manager .	this is the last and final offer we can give you .
how about meeting each other half - way in order to conclude the business ?	yes , the deal is too good to be true .	please contact us again .	thank you .	sounds good .
agreed .	let's meet up to discuss .	no , i don't think so , i'll take my business elsewhere .	that could work . i'll give 2 % above my previous counter - offer .	this is too much hassle . i'll just find someone else with more reasonable prices .
chinese people don't like to eat cold food .	cold milk wakes me up also .	that makes sense .	i love cereal also !	duh !
is that right ?	ah interesting ! any reason ?	why don't they ?	you should try it , you might like it !	you could eat cereal dry , as well .
but i'm open to new things . i'll have a bowl of cereal , too .	yes , chinese people prefer to eat warm food .	yeah , isn't it interesting ?	yes , they usually eat warm or room temperature food for breakfast .	yes , they may prefer a breakfast of rice and eggs , would you like that ?
with cold milk ?	sounds good	coming right up	that is weird	i m sure you will
with cold milk !	i guess so , since that's how i'm supposed to have it !	haha , yes of course !	maybe , but i might like it better dry .	yes , i'll try it !
okay , i'll be down there shortly .	thank you so much !	10 cents ? that's ridiculous	is the copy machine available 24/7 ?	do you have 10 cents ?
you probably won't have to wait for anyone , sir .	great ! glad i could help .	that sounds fine .	i'll tell them you're coming .	thanks for coming in ! have a good night !
how many seats are there in the stand ?	i can't wait !	i'm looking forward to it !	what do you think the stadium will be used for ?	how many people do you think the stadium will hold ?
oh , there are 5000 seats in total .	65 ,000 and 150 luxury boxes .	the seating is variable , which makes the stadium multi - purpose after the olympics .	there's 30 ,000 in the first deck and 35 in the second .	i don't actually know , but it's a lot that for certain !
i didn't know it would be so big !	that is a lot of seats	that is not enough seats	that is just the right amount	that is more than enough
it is ! look there , those are the tracks . and the jumping pit is over there .	5000 is not a lot of seats	it is not that big for an olympic stadium	the other stadiums are bigger	yeah , it is really nice and has room for all kinds of activities
ah . . . i see . hey , look the sign here , no climbing .	is the stadium going to be large enough for the olympic crowds ?	where is the pole vault section ?	i can hear myself echo in the empty stadium	where do the marathon runners re - enter the stadium ?
we put many signs with english translations for foreign visitors .	i see that sign everywhere	yeah we should leave the climbing to the olympians	that sign is for children	that is a funny sign
oh , great idea !	i was really hoping to not have to have a roomie .	yeah , that's an option .	i was looking for a studio , it doesn't have to be very big .	i've never had a roommate , i'm sure i can get a friend to room with me .
yes . could you tell many balance ? here's account number .	i need some quarters as well	i could use a newspaper and some chewing gum	no , that will be it , thank you so much	yes , i need a bottled water and a snickers bar
i'll give you a blood test . would you roll up your sleeve ? just as i thought . you're anemic . you'd better pay more attention to your diet . eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . and don't stay up late working . try to get more rest .	we will get to the bottom of this in no time	let me examine you and see what i can find	you have a high fever	we can get you some medication
thank you .	wait , what does " anemic " mean ?	what kind of foods are high in protein ?	i can't be anemic . i take iron supplements !	but i can't help staying up late working with my job schedule .
more or less . i go to three different buildings , and always get there late . i feel so hopeless . i don't know why i am late all the time . no one else seems to be .	i know that i have to go to the main building for my first class	i know the name of the building , but i don't know where it is .	i don't know where the building is for my first class .	i'm not certain , but i think the first one is in the computer science building .
that's because you don't know the short cuts . you'll learn them after a while . i can show you the ropes .	you can contact me for help about finding your classes .	it's okay , many people call me to complain about being late . it's more common than you think .	perhaps you could try the map on your phone instead ?	why don't you tell me which building you need to go to now , and i'll tell you how to get there .
that's lincoln .	it's mr . samson , thank you .	yes , it's ms . adams .	just put it under " johnson " , please .	why do you need it ?
what do you like about him ?	so definitely not jones .	why are they the best ?	what do you like about them ?	let's go to the voting booths together .
he is very intelligent .	for one thing he's authentic and honest .	i really like his stand on the issues . that's most important .	his got lots of experience and that means a lot to me .	just about everything . i can't think of anything i disagree about with him .
you think so ?	i don't think so .	some would disagree .	are you afraid to say their name ?	i think we are voting for the same person .
that's right . plus , i agree with his policies .	yes , i enjoyed his last speech .	yes , he is always so eloquent when he speaks .	yes . did you know he graduated first of his class from yale ?	yes , i think he will do us a world of good .
i'm glad to hear that you are so excited .	it's always easy to like someone you agree with .	what do you think about the chances he'll keep his promises once elected ?	any hint of corruption in his background ?	what's his family situation ?
i'm voting for the next president .	yeah he is the best	yeah i have faith in him	yeah i know he will do the right thing	yeah he is awesome
i'm sure he will be .	do you have any idea , who that might be ?	when will you vote ?	are you excited to vote ?	i may or may not vote
i'm going to make sure and vote .	he'll be elected for sure !	i really like his policies on prison reform !	who are you voting for ?	i'm sorry , i forgot to ask if you're voting .
that's for the phone calls you made from your room .	let's see . that charge is for room service last night .	that's the vat tax for last night's accommodations .	i believe you used some beverages from the minibar .	that appears to be for the rollaway bed you ordered for your stay .
can i pay with traveller's cheques ?	i didn't make any calls .	you must be mistaken .	14 pounds for 2 calls ? that outrageous .	i bet i will use my cell phone next time .
certainly . may i have your passport , please ?	of course , sir .	i'm afraid that we don't accept traveler's cheques , sir .	i will have to check with my supervisor .	i'm not sure . let me look that up in our protocol book .
here you are .	you have my passport in the safe .	the local police have my passport . i witnessed a crime last evening and they kept it .	oh , i misplaced it . i'm on my way to the embassy after i check out .	why do you need my passport for check - out ?
could you sign each cheque here for me ?	this passport is fake	this passport is expired	this passport is about to fall apart	this is not a passport
sure .	ok	sure	have a pen ?	alrighty
here are your receipt and your change , sir . thank you .	thank you , this will be just a moment .	can i see another form of i d ? your signature is different than the one of the cheque .	i could cash an extra one for you if you like for traveling money .	and will there be anything else i can help you with ?
thank you . goodbye .	thank you very much .	i appreciate your help .	thanks , have a nice day .	thanks for everything .
what are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?	what are your strengths ?	tell me about a conflict you recently resolved .	i think you would be a good fit here .	i am going to recommend you for the position .
the only thing i really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . i want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that i have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . i believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior .	he was often too lax and laid back . it caused a lot of extra work for those of us who wanted to get things done .	he was caught stealing money . it made me sick because i liked him so much that i didn't want to believe it . but he confessed . i lost so much respect for him .	he was often late . we couldn't get started without him . i really disliked having to wait around when i could be doing something constructive .	i don't think she really liked her job . she didn't put forth a lot of energy and joy into it .
how do you organize and plan for major projects ?	what kind of performance review did you receive for your last job ?	where do you see yourself in 5 years ?	have you ever been dismissed from a job ?	were you popular with your co - workers at your last place of employment ?
i love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . then , i set a timetable that's realistic . what i usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because i've already visualized what could happen and how i'd react .	i write my plans down	i speak to other people	i brainstorm ideas	i sit down and think
describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure .	do you look for input from your subordinates ?	are subordinates encouraged to speak up about issues and concerns ?	do you trust subordinates with high responsibility tasks ?	what tools do you use to manage your schedule ?
i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was on the road for two consecutive weeks . the amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because i could't bring my office files with me . luckily i had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed .	one time my office was flooded from the water fountain next door . i had to get a proposal out that afternoon while there were still plumbers wandering around the place .	my boss was taken sick unexpectedly and i had to take over her job as well as doing mine .	when my wife gave birth to our fourth child , i had to figure out how to balance the new baby with the proposal that was due the next day .	government regulators came by last year to search my boss'office and i had to figure out what to tell the press .
how do you manage your time in a typical day ?	have you ever employed a technology to decrease the amount of phone calls necessary ?	how would you improve the communications between your team members ?	what types of motivational tactics do you feel comfortable using with your team ?	describe a time when you felt overworked , and underappreciated .
i've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . the last thing i do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which i take care of at the end of the day or week .	i look at my schedule and try to budget my time efficiently .	i stick to a very rigid schedule .	i always work through my lunch .	i rarely take a break once i start working .
describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion .	that sounds reasonable	that sounds good	that is smart	i agree with what you do
i changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings .	one time a coworker suggested me to approach a situation with a client in a way i was not used to , and it was better in the long run .	my manager have me a plan of action that went against my norm , but in the end it worked out for the best for everybody .	we had a conflict in the office and my coworker gave me a suggestion on how to alleviate some tension . i incorporated her advice and we were able to remedy the situation at hand .	i normally do not act on other's suggestions . i think for myself , and i believe that i know what is best for our clients .
it's worth a shot . maybe we'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case .	no , i don't think the dalai lama sent it . but what does it hurt to throw a little positive thinking around ?	perhaps you are right . they are a waste of time .	i'm sorry you feel that way . perhaps you can ask him to take you off his mailing list .	a little inspiration in your inbox isn't so terrible . you can always delete it and move on .
he shouldn't drive his car . he should come here by bus .	i'm glad it's not just me , then .	oh , good ! is the conference room all set up ?	wonderful , that will give me some time to go over the proposal once last time .	okay . well , if you all would like to follow me into the conference room , we can wait for him in there .
okay . i could go for that . it's called al's steakhouse . they also have great fried fish , and i love their salad bar . you can go back to refill your plate as often as you like .	no . i prefer take out .	ok . . . that sounds ok with me .	i've heard it's not very good . is there another place nearby ?	i don't like all you can eat places because the food is usually stale . how about another place ?
is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ?	is the rest of the food all you can eat too ?	what do they have on their salad bar ?	how are their steaks at al's ?	do they have anything other than steaks and fish ?
yes , their steaks are enormous . sometimes i can't finish what i've ordered .	yes , i got a steak that covered the whole plate .	their ribs are huge , you'll feel like fred the caveman	yes , even the fish portions are huge .	the last steak i got there looked like a roast .
what if that happens to me ? i hate to let food go to waste .	that is crazy	that is amazing	that is stupid	that is pushing greediness
don't worry . we'll just get a doggie bag .	you can always bring the leftovers home .	you can secretly throw out whatever food you don't finish .	pass it to me , i will finish it !	the food won't go to waste , we will just have to take small portiond
definitely !	that's what i've heard .	that's not it . they'll also base pay on how well we do on the tests .	who knows ? office gossip is never reliable .	i think so . i'm not sure i'll stick around if that happens .
if that information is exact , i guess our company is willing to promote someone .	i guess i better pay close attention to the lectures then .	i suspect that it is standard practice to test managerial skills .	why do you think they are testing our skills ?	at least they are providing us with a background to do well on the tests , with those lectures .
alright , give me the number . but put me on that waiting list as well .	what's the name of the bus company ?	i'm not sure i'm comfortable with such a long distance by bus . what makes this bus so good ?	what type of comforts and amenities are on this bus ?	how will i be compensated for this error on the airline's part ?
here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list .	the number you are looking for is 573 - 971 - 4316 .	i'll get that number for you sir , just one second .	let's get you signed up for the waiting list , and then i'll give you the number , sir .	not a problem sir , let's get you signed up and get you that number .
how many people are on the waiting list right now ?	i got so many numbers to remember already .	could you write down the number for me please ?	do you mind giving me a reminder when my number is called ?	i wouldn't mind waiting if i could sit down .
right now i show that there are 176 people on the list . and you are number 176 .	at the moment , there are four other people on the waiting list .	you are the first on the list .	you are the third on the list of seven people total on the wait list .	you only have one other person ahead of you on the list .
yes , it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive .	what confines make it so hard ? the solution is purely pragmatic . why does it need to be so complicated ?	why is this such a hard matter to resolve ?	why is this issue so difficult ? the solution is simple . people make it more difficult than what it should be .	i don't understand why this needs to be more difficult than what it is . please , explain .
it's so small . the fact that there is public interest , doesn't say much for us as the public .	i wish they would just focus on the issues .	i know it works , but it's still annoying .	it's too bad because it doesn't help anyone .	there has to be a better way .
have you ever listened to am radio ? it's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on tv and fm radio .	it's so frustrating .	i wish people like us could do something .	think of how dumb the average person is . then realize that half of the population is dumber than that .	it'll be over eventually .
i don't remember the last time i listened to am radio .	i tried it once . it's not any better .	i might give it a shot in the future .	are there any channels you'd recommend ?	i used to listen , but i got sick of all of the commercials .
another place you can get real insight is european papers . you can get them on - line .	you should give it a try ! it's a much more enjoyable experience when it comes to news and politics .	i listen to it all the time . i feel much more educated and well informed when it comes to news .	what do you usually listen to when you're driving ? you really should give it a shot again .	it really does a good job of making me less cynical when it comes to politics and news in today's day and age .
sure . do you have my number ?	yes , it's no problem .	i don't really have a choice , do i ?	well , okay , i suppose .	i'm going out soon . i'll call back tomorrow .
yes , i have it right here . i'm so sorry about this .	yes we do it is in the system . i will call you when the system is back up .	yes , but why don't you give it to me again and i will write it down just in case .	yes i have 307 - 274 - 4214 is that correct ?	no we do not i am ready to copy it down .
no problem . i'll wait for your call .	no problem .	that's ok .	nothing to worry about .	it is fine .
great ! do you think you have a chance at getting the job ?	if you want help , i can take a look at it once you're finished .	what kind of job is it ?	i hope everything works out for you .	i'm good at writing resumes . i can give you some advice if you'd like .
i didn't just find out about one job . there were several ones that looked good .	it will be tough , there is a lot of strong competition out there for this position .	i am not really sure , but if i get an interview i think my confidence will help me out a lot .	i am not really sure , but if i get an interview i think my confidence will help me out a lot .	i think so . i have a lot of experience and i think my skills and background speak for themselves .
maybe i should try looking on the web for work .	that is great news .	how many ?	which one are do you like ?	nice job .
sure you have to be patient . but i think it's much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls .	i will email some to you .	the internet is a good source for job searching .	maybe we will end up working at the same place .	where were you looking before .
but there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . you might have no chance .	who goes door to door anymore ?	what site did you use to find these jobs ?	have you gotten any phone calls or emails back yet ?	i am going to start looking tonight
how do you know if you don't have a try ?	with enough applications , i'm bound to get one .	i'm also dropping resumes at the most promising locations .	i hadn't thought of that .	but not all of those people are qualified for the job !
thanks . what kind of stone is this ?	thank you how much is it ?	thank you how do you think it looks on me ?	thank you ! what can you tell me about this necklace ?	great it is really pretty how much is the price ?

it looks good . ok . i'll take it .	that sounds reasonable .	could you bring down the price a bit ?	can i get a discount if i also buy the matching earrings ?	could i also get it appraised after buying it ?
i'm very glad to hear that .	i know . that's why i got .	remember this when my birthday comes around .	what are best friends for ?	you deserve it jim .
come here , let me introduce some friends to you .	that was rude of me to say i was expecting a gift from you , i'm sorry	i hope you bought me the right size this year	this present is what i always wanted	thank you so much for my wonderful gift
it sounds like you are coming down with the flu . let me take your temperature .	you should go home and get some rest .	you should go to the doctor's .	you might want to try vitamin c to get better .	my grandma always said that chicken soup and hot tea was the best cure for this sort of thing .
have i got a high fever ?	i started feeling sick last week .	i started feeling sick yesterday and it's just getting worse .	i just started feeling sick an hour ago .	i've been sick off and on for the past month .
yes , thirty - eight point seven . do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ?	no , everything looks fine .	it does nt look very good .	i think you should see a doctor .	i ca nt tell for sure .
yes , i have .	maybe just a little . what do you think it is ?	i don't think so , i'm just not feeling well .	no . i think it might be something i ate last night .	a slight headache .
now , let me have a look at you . i'd like to listen to your chest . now breathe in , a deep breath , that's it cough , now again . i want to examine your throat , too . open wide , say'ah - - '	can you show me where it hurts the most ?	are you feeling any other symptoms ?	have you already taken any medicine ?	let's see if we can find some medicine for you .
aaaaahh , aaaaahh .	my throat hurts .	does my throat look red ?	how does my chest sound ?	i am opening my mouth as wide as i can
yes , it does look a bit sore . let's take an x - ray of your chest and give you a few tests .	that looks really bad .	oof . . . your throat is pretty red and inflamed .	well , i found the problem . it's an infection of some sort .	ugh . . . something bad is going on in there . you should get to a doctor .
all right , thanks .	wait , i really need an x - ray ?	dang . i have an important meeting this week .	i hope it isn't anything more serious .	ok .
the tests showed nothing wrong . a slight viral infection .	i'll prescribe you a mild antibiotic just in case . take them twice a day with a full glass of water .	i think you have a cold . i'll give you some antibiotics , and you can purchase some painkillers at the pharmacy for your pain .	my assistant here will guide you to the x - ray machine . when you're done , you can head to the receptionist's desk for your bill and prescription .	follow me to the x - ray room . this will just take a few moments .
what shall i do today ?	what do you mean a slight viral infection ?	by slight , does that mean i don't have to take any antibiotics ?	so do you think i'll recover in a day or two ?	what should i take to take care of this infection ?
i'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . take an aspirin when you've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . drink plenty of water , then you'll feel better . here's the prescription .	well i think i'll sleep in today cause even though nothing shows up as wrong i still do not feel good .	i do not have anything planed for today anyway .	normally i would clean my house but not today .	maybe if i rest i will feel better tomorrow .
it's not too much , only about $ 85 .	too much , i'm sure .	i'm not worried about the price , it's the hassle .	i don't know .	with the installation cost , it might be cheaper to buy a new computer .
plus installation ?	oh , really ? that's not bad at all .	oh wow , i thought it would be more than that .	that's reasonable . did you buy it yet ?	do you have to purchase it directly from hp ?
no , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace .	no , installation is extra of course	they said it was free installation	yes , isn't that a great deal ?	i forgot to ask .
really ?	you're going to do it yourself ?	do you have the tools to safely pick apart your computer ?	have you removed and replaced a hard drive before ?	when are you planning of knocking that out ?
yes , it's just a couple of screws .	yeah , i didn't realize it would be this easy either .	i'll get ryan to do it for me .	yeah . this is great because it means i can get back to work sooner .	right ? i'm wondering why i didn't call them sooner .
that's nice .	that's great you know how to do that . i'm all thumbs when it comes to working on computers .	i'm always afraid i'll be electrocuted if i touch any components of my computer .	is there any chance you could damage the components ?	how do you attach the hard drive to the mainframe of the computer ?
it's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 .	it is nice because it's something i can do myself .	yes , it's nice . i don't have to pay extra for the installation .	it's pretty cool because i don't have to dish out more money for the installation .	yes , i'm lucky because i can install it myself .
if my hard drive crashes , i'll just call you .	i'm glad it an easy fix . good luck .	it sounds like you know what your doing .	i hope your computer works well for a long time after that .	was there anything else wrong with your computer ?
yes . we come at the right time .	yes , it is very calm .	yes , it's so tranquil to look at .	it is quite calm . it's so nice to be out in nature .	half an hour ? i thought it would be longer .
yes , you may consider those two places also . seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there's a very famous museum called museum of flight .	those are wonderful places to visit as well .	i'd pick seattle . hawaii is beautiful but life on those islands is quite different from mainland america . if you want to see the crux of american culture , i'd definitely go to the mainland .	hawaii is gorgeous . you should definitely go if you get the chance !	well , would you prefer to go someplace urban , or some place on a tropical island ?
and seattle is the home of microsoft and boeing . that must be a great place . i can't miss it .	have you been to that museum before ?	is the museum of flight about airplanes ?	i'll make sure to go to the museum . what else should i do in seattle ?	seattle sounds interesting , but i really need to consider hawaii . they have beautiful beaches .
this home is gorgeous on the inside !	i can't wait to see it .	do you have time to give me a tour ?	if it's half as nice as the exterior , it will be fantastic .	if it's half as nice as the exterior , it will be fantastic .
everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new .	yes , it was just remodeled .	they've done a nice job furnishing it .	it's also wheelchair accessible . the man who lives here is disabled .	they've got wonderful taste , don't they ?
the wall colors totally suit the style of this house .	i can't believe how perfect this house is !	i think we should make an offer .	those bathrooms are really impressive !	that interior was obviously designed by someone with a sense of style !
straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen .	yes , they have a great decorator .	glad you liked the style .	the style is very modern .	it goes well with the rest of the house .
i love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops .	oh wow what is in the kitchen ?	how many gas burners does it have ?	it has so many cabinets !	i love the design of the kitchen tile
the master suite is the best . let's go look at that next .	the gorgeous sunroom out the back was added in 2014 .	to your left is the master bathroom , complete with jacuzzi .	to your right is the study with its fantastic natural lighting .	the view from the picture window to your left is unparalleled .
there is plenty of room for our king - sized bed , and i love the light in this room .	what is the square footage ?	i can't wait to see it .	i love this house so far , and i'm sure i'll love the suite too .	hopefully it will be as great as the rest of the house .
i know that you like this house , but let's take a look at the others before you make up your mind .	have you seen the outdoor patio ?	the bathrooms are decorated with the finest linoleum floors .	the deck has a hot tub for the winter time !	you should check out the guest bedrooms in the basement .
will that be first class or economy seat ?	at what time ?	would you like first class , business , or coach ?	do you have a seat preference ?	will you need a refundable ticket ?
what's the fare for a first class seat ?	economy , please .	what is the difference in price ?	do you have any deals on first class ?	i don't care , i just want a window seat .
$ 200 .	the first class seat fares start at $ 1000 .	we have a few specials right now .	we can sit you in front for just a bit more .	we only have a few seats left .
oh . i am not a wall streeter . give me an economy one please .	sounds good , can you book me a ticket please ?	that's a little pricey , is there anything cheaper ?	can i get an aisle seat ?	do you accept cash or only credit card ?
yes . and if you already have a current account with us , the insurance premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle .	of course . we can help you with that now if you'd like .	it's not really a purchase , but an investment .	if you'll step over here i'll have a manager assist you .	of course . how much money are you planning on depositing ?
yes , there has been a lot of research into rsi's . something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . tell me , did anything else influence your decision ?	wow , i never would have guessed . was there anything else that factored into your decision ?	that's interesting . i do know we take our employees'health very seriously , so you're in the right place .	thanks for the input . we'd also like to know what you think of our new employee orientation program . can you tell me about its strengths and areas for improvement ?	well , you'll be first in line for the new ergonomic keyboards !
yes , i noticed that you have professional training and team - building days . i like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff .	no , nothing else influenced me .	i took a look at the square footage as well .	there were other factors that i didn't mention .	yes , many things .
well , welcome to the team .	that's very true . our staff is like family .	great to hear ! we treat our staff like we all would like to be treated .	that's awesome . we invest much time and love into our entire staff .	yes , that's correct ! we feel our staff's well being is important to the company .

correct . show respect for the older people . conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other .	yes , that sounds right .	wow , you are so smart .	i think that's right ?	maybe .
any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?	there is a lot of protocol to follow with the meals .	i hope i can remember all of the correct steps to take at the next dinner .	why are women excluded from the initial toasts ? i don't agree with that at all .	i am too nervous with all of these instructions to follow . i know i will forget something !
yes , plenty of them . don't eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely .	do not make a lot of eye contact , it is considered to be quite rude	that is all of the advice i have for you .	no , you now know everything you have to	no more rules , i have explained everything to you . now you can take this knowledge and apply it to apply modesty .
is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?	that sounds like a lot to remember . anything else ?	i think i can manage all that . anything else i should know ?	are there any specific things i should know about the seating arrangements ?	how much food should i leave exactly ?
haha , i'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate .	yes , exactly , they will keep serving you food unless you leave a little bit	yes , it shows that you are full if you have leftover food on your plate	it sounds wasteful to leave food , but it shows you have gotten enough to eat	yeah , it is pretty weird , but just leave a little bit on the plate
i think the only thing is toner . try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . we should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time .	i am not sure .	maybe .	i will ask our supplier .	i think so , i have to double check .
ok , will do .	yes , i will ask the supplier to over night ship the order .	i will make a note to check all toners on a monthly basis from now on and will ask for expedited shipping on the order .	i placed the order and was told we will have the toner cartridges by 9:00 a .m . tomorrow morning .	the supplier is able to rush the order for delivery the day after tomorrow .
oh , i like the color .	that's not really my style . it is a bit too flashy .	i would prefer the classic style . do you carry it in my size .	oh , that is cool . may i try them on ?	perhaps if they were in a different color . what other colors do you have ?
i'm afraid all the big tables are taken .	what kind of room are you looking for ?	sorry , we do nt have anything available .	let me check see i can do .	we only have the king suite available .
will i be able to read the results on the website and understand them ?	thank you so much .	great , that s a huge relief .	glad to hear it .	that s great news , i was worried there for a sec .
yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about .	yes . let me know if you have trouble understanding anything .	if you have a hard time understanding anything , let me know .	if you have a hard time understanding anything , let me know .	your test results came back fine . you can ask me anything you don't understand .
how will i know what the numbers mean ?	i think i would rather come in .	i am afraid to look .	i will check it out and call back if i have any questions .	i think i am way too nervous .
you can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .	google , it's your friend .	there are ranges of numbers in the far right column , that's the objective range , it's what you want your numbers within .	hover over the numbers with your mouse and a pop - up will tell you what each one means .	just email any questions you have and i'll answer it before 10 pm .
how can i see test results from tests i have taken before ?	ok , good to know . i'll do that now . thank you !	i'm really hoping i passed the test and did well !	i am so nervous about the results of my test !	i think i did pretty good on the test , but i will go on the website to check . thanks !
we put all of your test results up in the same place . just check the dates for what you need .	there is a past results option .	the last 4 visits will also be listed with the current results .	you can search by date .	you can't from the website .
what's your proposal ?	even half way is too great of a gap , mr . lee .	mr . lee , we already gave you the rock - bottom price .	we can go down another 100 but that is it .	mr . lee , we would be happy to give you an additional 10 percent discount on the rock - bottom price we gave you but that is as low as we can go .
your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . well , i suggest we meet each other halfway .	i am willing to pay 500 .	maybe i should speak with your boss .	would you take off another 100 ?	i will search online for a better price .
do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that's impossible !	mr lee , you'll be takin'food out of my children's mouths at that price .	mr . lee , be reasonable , that's too low .	you can't find a better price anywhere and you know it !	come down fifty bucks , ok , i can do that for my best customer .
what would you suggest ?	apparently you don't want to do business with me so i will go elsewhere !	i think it's very possible , but you are too greedy !	i think it's very possible , but you are too greedy !	come now , i think you can work with me here . how about 60 dollars ?
the best we can do is another 30 dollars off . that's definitely the lowest we can go .	maybe a reduction of 25 dollars ?	we can give you other types of incentives .	you should consider all we provide for our price .	here is my counter offer .
that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . let's meet each other half - away again and split the difference ; i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .	i thought the earlier offer was the lowest you could go ?	okay , that's more like it . we have a deal .	i can see you don't want this sale . i will take my business elsewhere . thank you .	okay . i accept your offer .
ok . we can meet halfway again .	sounds fair .	sounds good .	meet me halfway please .	ok .
b as in boy . you should get off at the last stop in chinatown .	good question . i am going to google it , carl .	let's meet at the d bus .	no problem . let's meet in between the bus stops later .	i didn't say ! good question . lets meet at the starbucks across the street of the terminal .
oh , you mean canal street ?	okay . see you there .	i was definitely going to get on the wrong bus .	how long do you think the ride is ?	i haven't been that far into chinatown before .
that's the wrong direction . canal street is on the other side of chinatown .	yes , that's the street the terminal's on .	no , it's actually on bowery , i'll see you there !	no , it's avenue b like i said .	yeah , i see you then !
oh , i get it . when did we decide to meet ?	oh , so you mean the other way on main street .	now i know where you're talking about . i think there is a deli right by there .	ok , that means i've gone way too far if i reach canal street .	i guess i'm not very familiar with that route .
at 10 ,45 . is ann coming along ?	did you pay attention at all ?	oh my . you're gon na get lost .	we are meeting at noon .	i want to make sure you know where you are going first .
i can not get hold of her yet .	not today , she isn't feeling well .	i think so , let me ask her .	yes she is . we can't wait to see you .	she wanted to , but she had already made other plans .
see you around , carl .	where is she ?	i will contact her instead .	wow , she is late .	where is ann ? ?
see you later .	ok . bye ruth .	see you in chinatown .	ok . see you . i'll try ann again .	yes . see you soon .
what happens if you exceed the limits ?	has that effected durability ?	that will reduce potential legal liabilities in the future i'm sure .	i thought you'd cut lead out twenty years ago .	how will that effect production costs ?
we try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine .	if we exceeded the limits , we would get severely fined .	i don't want to find out . i'm complying with all codes .	they could potentially shut my company down .	if i did that , i would lose everything if the government found out .
how much do you like to exchange ?	how much euro would you like to buy ?	how much rib do you have ?	excellent , are you ready to begin the transaction ?	great , i'm happy to help you exchange then
20 ,000 rib .	i would like to purchase 100 euro .	how much would you recommend exchanging ?	okay , how much euros can i get for 10 ,000 rib ?	i'll exchange all the rib i have for as many euros as possible , please .
in what denominations ?	fine , give me a minute to make the exchange .	thank you , just a moment . i'll be right back with your euros .	thank you . 20 ,000 rib is a bit higher than i am authorized to exchange . let me call the manager to approve it and it'll just take a few minutes after that . thank you for you patience .	okay , here are your euros . let me count it out for you . and , is there anything else i can help you with ?
it doesn't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life .	i don't mind which ; whatever is easiest for you is fine .	i'll take denominations in a single hundred and the rest 50	i'd like my denominations to be all 100's , please .	i'd like them all as 20's , please .

well , could you change them too ? the dollars , i want to change them into swiss francs .	i do nt yet have a telephone number .	great , thank you so much .	where is the form .	do you need my passport ?
ok , wait for a moment . well , i am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . in this case , you'd better change 2 ,000 $ to swiss francs .	i would be happy to do that for you .	i can change the dollars to francs as well .	i can do that , but it will be an extra fee .	i can change that for you but will be a new transaction .
it doesn't matter .	so is there no way to accept coins	i really want to do away with these coins	where can i get the coin exchange	coins are too much on me
please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo .	so , you would be content with making the switch ?	i just want to make sure -- are you okay with making that adjustment ?	are you sure , sir ?	sir , are you sure ? i want to make sure you're pleased .
thanks a lot . good - bye .	okay , i can do that	what about the coins	why must it be 2000	okay , i will .
i am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here .	sounds good , let's go inside .	i can't wait to see what the inside looks like .	i hope that there is a nice bathroom .	i wonder what the kitchen looks like .

the asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty - five thousand dollars .	yes it is , you can find at the bottom of the page .	no , it isn't , but i have that information available . would you like me to tell you the price ?	no , it isn't . but the price is $ 425 ,000 . the seller is also accepting reasonable offers .	yes it is , you can see it at the bottom of this page . the price is $ 425 ,000 .

it was for 10	it was at 3 p .m .	i can't remember exactly , but it was in the morning .	i think it was 9 in the morning .	i'm afraid i can't remember , and i don't have my calender with me .
i am looking at your appointment right now . what day would you prefer ?	ok , i'll cancel that appointment .	would you like to reschedule it for another day ?	thank you so much for letting us know .	my records show it was actually on tuesday , can you make it then ?
i would prefer next thursday .	i was hoping to come in on friday , if that works .	i would really like to come in the following monday if you have an opening .	next tuesday would be ideal , but i could also do thursday .	ideally i would like to reschedule for next wednesday . is that an option ?
what time would be best for you ?	we don't have 10 open , how about 11 ?	yes , we have a spot at 10 on that day , does that work for you ?	we are fully booked for that day , can you do friday ?	what time on thursday ? we are pretty open that day .

you can't be serious .	$ 2 ,500 seems kind of high . are there any discounts available ?	that sounds great . does it have 4k ?	that's a little more than i was looking to spend . is there anything similar ?	that seems high . are there any sales coming up soon ?
that's how much this t . v costs .	i am serious .	do you think that is too high ?	i know , it's quite a bargain .	i paid 3000 for it , so it's a pretty good deal .
that's too expensive for me .	that is way more than what the tv is worth	okay well that's out of my price range , thanks !	would you be willing to negotiate that price ?	i'll give you $ 1000 for it
this television is of very high quality .	well it is a really nice t .v .	it is a very big size , so that is why the price .	well we can negotiate .	what do you have to spend ?
you can't go down on the price .	sorry , can't do it .	nope , not happening .	maybe we can haggle a bit ?	what else do you got ?
by how much ?	i can not , sorry	unfortunately no , no i can not	maybe slightly , how about 2250	not really , no .
i'll buy it for $ 2000 .	by a little hundreds	you can remove a discount	just too much for me	help me with a cheaper one
i'm sorry , but the price is final .	i'll have to think about it .	that s too low .	how about 2225 ?	ok , sounds good to me .

it's traditional chinese medicine . i mix it with hot water like tea . sorry . i forgot about it .	that is my hair gel .	that is my sleep apnea mask .	i'm not sure i have never seen that before .	i do not know . that is not mine .

i am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . i have to consider your mother's life .	i think it is a good value .	i think we need it in case something happens .	i want to make sure your mother is taken care of .	i want to know my family will be taken care of .

pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self - cultivation . good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable .	i spoke of the training i had done in my previous position .	i was very open about my work experiences with my previous companies .	i'd spoken with the human resources director very candidly .	i had spoken about my educational background that led me to my choice in this career field .

i need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper .	i can't . i already have plans - what about tomorrow though ?	that would a lot of fun - sure !	what were you thnking about seeing ?	sure- what's playing right now ?
ok . what about going to the movies on friday night ?	oh , okay . best of luck !	really ? when is it due	oh , i already finished that one , i could help you	darrn , okay :(

i was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer .	i wanted to see the new action movie .	i wanted to see the new comedy .	i don't know , what do you want to see ?	why don't you look and see what looks good .
how about " the secret life of bees " ?	why would you want to see that ?	um not thanks .	what s are the critics saying ?	is it any good ?
that's a chick flick !	that does sound much happier than my idea	no thank you , let's watch the rapist one	that sounds quite interesting	are you sure you wouldn't prefer the movie about the rapist serial killer ?
here is your valuable . is that right ?	thank you .	how good your service is .	this is great , you're so efficient .	thanks for making this painless .
yes , thank you .	where is the rest of it ?	that's it .	do you have a bag ?	it's just as i remember it .
no , i think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions .	i don't know that most people in america believe that .	i think it's more the politicians than the american people .	there's too much brain washing by the church .	i think they don't really understand the issue .
it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america .	yes that sounds about right . older generations don't agree with abortions .	you think so , i don't think older generations are the only ones against abortions .	can you blame the older generations , they want the best for the younger generations . abortion isn't good for our society .	i think older generations should get with the program . it's 2019 , and if a woman wants to abort that she has every right to do so .
religious people blame it on pre - marital sex , not on abortion being illegal .	yes , the old generations are too prudish .	what does abortions have to do with teen pregnancies ?	yes , i agree .	i think that's more of an issue of education .
what do you think about abortion ?	blaming pregnancy on sex , that makes sense i guess .	i read somewhere that teen pregnancy was actually going down .	anti - abortion protests seem to be getting less vocal these days .	i thought roe v wade was considered settled law .
i personally would never want to have one , but i think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself .	i think it should be legal	i think women should have the choice .	i don't think the government should have a say	it is a reasonable option
do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ?	interesting , thank you for sharing you opinion .	i agree , that is how it should be .	do you think that people's opinions are changing ?	why do you think that way ?
i know this is going to sound sexist , but i don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children .	no .	yes .	maybe .	i would really have to think on that .
why not ? it's their children , too .	i'm not sure how i feel about it . i definitely see both sides .	i think the father should have a say in the situation . it's his baby too !	i know it does affect the mother , but what if the father wants to raise the child ?	it's a tough situation , but i do wish there was more awareness and use of birth control to avoid the whole situation !
that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand .	but its the womans boday .	that s a good point .	i never thought of it that way .	yeah , its definitely a complex issue .
that might be true , but i think men should have some kind of say in the matter .	i agree with you that pregnancy is not easy	when i got pregnant i became more aggressive	i home you know that it is their children too	men have to work to bring money home to them
you say that now , lily , but you'll thank me later . i'm your mom , and mother knows best .	i want you to be able to be the best you can be .	you know you need to get a scholarship .	i just want you to make good use of your time .	it doesn't hurt to be prepared .
i'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision .	i hope so too . thank you for your help .	great , i look forward to hearing from you on monday .	monday works ! i will wait for your phone call .	please call whenever you want . i will be available any time .
how much do apartments cost around here ?	yeah , but how reliable are those ?	i don't want to end up with some nihilistic slob !	i've already got an idea of who i want as a roommate .	what like craigslist ?
it depends on what you want . do you want a one - or two - bedroom apartment ?	depends on how many bedrooms you want	they are around $ 1000	depends on the amenities you need	there is a website that will show you your options
i just need a one - bedroom apartment .	i think i want a 1 bedroom .	i think i want a 2 bedroom .	i think 2 would be better with a roommate .	i'm not sure , depends on the prices .
that will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month .	ok that'll be easy enough .	no problem .	yes we can do that .	and the view ?
would you come with me to look at apartments ?	that's about what i figured , but that's a lot to come up with every month .	on second thought , maybe i should check into a two - bedroom apartment and find a roommate . i think that will be more feasible for me .	ok , well twelve hundred is less then what i had originally thought .	wow , the rent here is so expensive ! i may need to find a roommate !
i would be happy to look at apartments with you .	sure , when you want to go ?	i m free during the weekend .	let me see when i m free ?	sounds like fun .
i thought you knew .	she had a boy	she had a girl	yeah she had it yesterday	they didn't tell many people
i honestly didn't know .	she never told me .	she should have called me .	i ca nt believe she didn't tell me .	i am so happy for her .
the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces .	she didn't tell you ?	well now you know .	are you going to see it ?	are you going to give her a ring ?
that's good to hear .	wow , i'm surprised the baby weighed so much since she was early !	that's a good size . is the baby healthy ?	my goodness , i had no idea ! i better go visit her and the baby !	oh , she must be so happy ! probably exhausted too ! i'll pay her a visit soon .
will you go and visit them ?	i ca nt believe they did nt tell you .	yeah , they re all doing good .	want me to send you pics ?	you should come to the hospital .
of course i will .	later today i would go there	weekends is the best time to visit	let us all go there now	i don't think i would be going
i just wanted to give you the good news .	let's go together .	we should get them a gift .	i bet it looks just like her .	i can't wait to have a baby of my own .
thanks for letting me know .	thank you . i love good news .	i can't wait to see the new baby .	i can't believe she didn't tell me .	i will go see them soon .
maybe the situation is too urgent .	i think it's better to use the stairs than the window .	you are crazy to jump out the window .	how did you think the window was a better idea ?	you could of hurt yourself even more .
yes , i think i should have jumped in any case .	maybe not .	i didn't think so .	maybe your right .	i wasn't thinking .
those are the only things you eat ?	where do you go to buy groceries .	healthy food is so expensive .	i wish i knew how to cook .	why chicken . is it healthier ?
that's basically what i eat .	yes for protein\	i now take less starch	i don't know other foods	i eat a lot others this is just a few
why aren't you eating anything else ?	i hear that fish is pretty good .	sounds like you eat a lot of salad .	do you like smoothies ?	i've been trying to eat better , but i always fail .
well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy .	they are not as healthy .	i don't like the taste of much else .	i really want to eat healthy all the time .	it is the best thing to eat .
and the chicken ?	yeah , but there is so much more to eat .	what about fish ?	yes , but have you tasted steak ? its delicious .	what do you drink ?
it's really healthy to eat when you bake it .	chicken is very healthy .	if it's just lean breast , it's low fat .	i have it with no skin , it's healthier .	chicken is very good for you .
i guess that does sound a lot healthier .	nice .	sounds great !	doesn't sound so bad .	that's pretty good .
today is my first day at work !	how long have you been here ?	i think i'm going to like it here .	this is a totally different workplace than my last job .	i am so excited to get to work !
well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! just ask me if you need any help .	great , happy to have you !	let me show you to your desk .	let me introduce you to everyone .	nice , i will grab the boss so he can talk to you .

you are welcome .	my office is just over there .	has anyone shown you the break room ?	don't drink the coffee if alex makes it , it's terrible .	i'll leave you to settle in , you're going to like it here .
what qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ?	oh , that's interesting .	i see .	what did your company advertise ?	how was that ?
i think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market .	they should have good organizational skills .	communication skills are the most important .	willingness to work with a team .	being creative is very important .
what was the most important thing you have learned at work ?	and what else ?	that sounds promising .	i like were your going .	interesting .
the most important thing i learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities . advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . if i want to make in marking in advertising industry , i can't stop studying and creating .	that teamwork is very helpful .	there is no such thing as a bad idea .	communication is key .	it just as important to follow orders as it is to give them .
i know a very interesting place .	i know a great spot downtown .	first round is on me .	i will let my wife know we are having a boys night .	we can share a cab after .
oh , do you ? good .	sounds cool , where is it ?	do they have food there ?	is there any music to listen to ?	awesome , let's get going .
i'll say the movie's starting in the minute .	i want to go buy popcorn first .	you head in . i'm going to the bathroom really quickly .	ok i'm ready to head in .	i want to buy a drink first .
i know . i wonder what's keeping him .	please find paul for me !	i can't go without paul	i hope he isn't too late for the start .	paul loves movies too much for this .
looks like he won't show up . he's done this before , hasn't he ?	i'm going to go in , you can keep waiting .	i'm sure he'll understand , let's just go in .	he probably got stuck in traffic .	have you called him yet ?
yeah , a number of times .	he does seem to be late a lot .	not usually , something could be wrong .	i'll try to call him .	a few times , but he's usually considerate .
what's he trying to pull anyway .	do you want me to save you a seat ?	is he answering texts ?	i'll save a seat , find me if he doesn't show up .	i'll get some popcorn to save you time .
i don't know . but this is definitely the last straw .	he likes to make me mad .	he likes to make me sad .	he likes to make me angry .	he likes to make me upset .
maybe you should start seeing someone else .	i agree we shouldn't invite him out anymore .	we should text him and tell him how mad we are .	we should go into the movie without him .	i'm not sure but i don't want to be his friend anymore .
you said it . ok , let's go in , sandy .	maybe i should just be on my own for a while .	you may be right , that would serve him right .	i don't know , he can be sweet at times .	you are right , i'm so tired of him .
turn on the air conditioner .	the heat makes me feel sick .	i need to drink some cold water to cool off .	we should turn the air conditioning up .	i'm going to change into cooler clothes . you should too .
it doesn't work .	you turn on the air conditioner	it's been broken for a while .	i will do that right now .	what temperature would you like ?
what happened ?	that sucks .	ah , maybe go to the movies . they have good air conditioning at the theater .	the library can be a good option .	ah , i guess you'll just have to endure it .
i don't know .	it made a clicking noise , but didn't turn on .	it's blowing hot air .	it's not doing anything at all .	it turns on but the fan doesn't work .
did you call the repairman ?	have you had anyone look at it ?	have you called anyone to check it ?	let me take a look at it .	maybe the filter just needs changing .
of course .	they went out of business !	they are closed to sunday .	he is out of town till next friday	i forgot .
when is he coming ?	did the repairman say when he could come ?	we should try fixing it ourselves .	i'm tired of it breaking . we should buy a new one instead of getting it repaired	i'll help pay for the repairman's fees .
he's busy . he said next week .	he said between 2 and 4 pm .	i hope it's soon .	he said he would come as quickly as he could .	you know how repairmen are , it could be anytime .
would you like another beer ?	then you will absolutely love this !	taste is for me	i have prepared you a plate .	it's right over there to get for yourself .
i'll have another cup of beer insist . i know i don't like to drink alone , especially there are someone sitting there next to me .	no , i've already had enough .	yes please , i think i will .	no thanks , beer doesn't go well with this food .	maybe , if you have another kind .
come on , it's the weekend . let's taste and enjoy this meal . cheers !	would you like to move to another seat ?	would you like to join a group of others ?	please let me know if you would like someone to talk to .	would you like to grab another snack ?
bottom's up , and you're right . this meal is incredible . i wish i had known this restaurant before . thanks for bringing me here . i know i'll be back agile soon .	cheers , this is great beer .	i think i will .	i agree , we should have fun .	thanks for the great advice .
what's the matter	what is it ?	what is it ?	what is it ?	what is it ?
i'm a little worried about my host family . you know , in the agreement i have to do some cooking for them .	i'm afraid of flying .	i still need to get a passport .	i'm sad about leaving my family .	i need to buy a new wardrobe since the weather is so different .
is it easy to learn ?	that sounds like a fun routine .	what if it's cloudy and you can't see your shadow ?	do all ages shadow box ?	i would be afraid of punching someone by accident .
yes . it is i can teach you if you like .	is it like bungfu ?	do you know of any bungfu groups ?	know anybody who does bungfu ?	can you teach me shadow boxing ?
thank you . i can teach you how to bowl .	that would be great .	do i need gloves ?	where's a good place to practice ?	it's nice of you to offer , i'll have to check my schedule .
right . let's help each other .	sounds like a plan . are you free tuesday ?	i would love to learn . where is your bowling alley ?	what days are you free ? i can go most days	do you bowl candleopins ?
all right . ask me a question now .	we don't know the red indians didn't originate here .	we don't call them red indians anymore .	red indians is a slur .	we do know about the vikings but they left no written records .
who invented the electric light bulb ?	who is the president of france ?	who discovered hawaii ?	when did king henry vii reign ?	who assassinated robert kennedy ?
that's easy . it was invented by edison .	was it tommy edison ?	i'm not sure . was it tesla ?	try a harder question	seriously , can you find a harder question ?
correct . now for a harder question . who will be the first men on mars ?	you got it right .	i should have asked you something harder .	that was much too easy for you .	i'll ask a harder question next time .
i can't answer that . but i think mars will be visited by men before theed of this century .	maybe it will be a woman first , i'm not sure !	i'm not sure but have you heard of mars one ?	whoever sets foot down first will likely live there from what i hear .	i'd imagine it would be some kind of mining company trying to make a profit .
ask me a question now .	you're probably right . what country do you think will get to mars first ?	okay , you're turn . ask me something now .	do you think we might get to another planet before mars ?	do you think it could happen in the next fifty years ?
all right . what is the nearest planet to the sun ?	okay sure . which country has the highest population ?	who was the author of around the world in 80 days ?	how many elements are there in the periodic table ?	who was the famous scientist that worked with radium ?
that's easy . it's . . er . venus . no . pluto . no . wait a minute . it's anthe tip of my tongue . oh dear , what is the nearest planet to the sun ?	the nearest planet to the sun is mercury .	i know it is now mars	that is a good question , i am not sure .	it could be venus , but i think it's mercury .
what does it say ?	i'm not familiar with that type of poem .	what will you name the poem ?	good luck with your poem .	that sounds like an interesting poem .
this is an especially famous one . it says " may the passing days bring you health and longevity . may this season of renewal find you basked in riches . "	you can read each of them right here .	take a look , i have many samples for people to view .	it's better to show you instead of tell you , so here take a look .	it says traditional chinese words formed into different couplets . take a look !
that's very nice . is it for sale ?	that's great ! who is the poet ?	that's fantastic ! how long have you been doing this ?	what a beautiful sentiment ! and the calligraphy just makes it even more so !	that's really uplifting ! who wrote it ?
no . i never sell my artwork .	i'm afraid not . this one has been specially requested .	this one has been spoken for .	this poem is already sold to the requestor .	it is not . i am sorry .
really ? then what do you do with it ?	you should think of selling your artwork .	i would buy some if you did sell it .	i can respect that .	i think people would pay for your art .
i give it away . here , this one is for you .	i just kind of keep them in a notebook .	i just stick them in a binder or something .	i post them to facebook once in a while .	nothing really . i just make them for me .
wow ! really ? are you sure ? now i'll have a lucky year !	oh wow thank you so much .	that is very generous of you to do that .	how do people respond when you just give it to them ?	thanks , i know just where i'll hang it .
remember , real luck must be created ( by ) yourself , and then it can not be given or taken away . . .	it's my pleasure .	certainly - this year will be your best year .	i'm positive . it's the least i can do for you waiting so long	i really think you will emjoy it .
definitely not . the most important thing was we loved each other .	what can i say ? i like a guy with a sense of humor .	not only was he funny , but sympathetic too . that's the trait that really won me over .	i didn't marry him for sense of humor alone , but it certainly helped !	a good laugh and a good heart are reason enough to marry a man i say .
well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes .	i wouldn't mind going some time to hear it for myself .	i think you should give it a shot .	i hear that too , but they always seem to know details that just seem weird .	lets go together sometime and see for ourselves !
all superstitious nonsense ! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks .	it's all smoke and mirrors .	you're being deceived .	none of that is real . it's all just a ruse .	it's just a fun act . they can't actually predict anything .
i'm sorry . it's out of stock now . could you come by again next week ?	let me look that up for you .	that it is in the 3rd row , on the bottom right , about half way down .	let me take a look - one moment please	i'd be happy to see if we have that available .

is it expensive ?	i didn't know that	is it this one ?	i see it	thanks for telling me
it is the most expensive .	it's more expensive than regular unleaded .	it's a bit more expensive but you'll get better performance .	it's a little more expensive but it's the best choice for your car .	not very . just a little bit more than regular .
well , i don't want it then . can i move to another pump ?	no , i don , t want that .	no . give me something cheaper , please .	i'll go look for a cheaper place .	oh well ok .fill it up !
yes , i can give you regular unleaded . but you have to back up the car a little .	sure , we have a medium option .	no i'm sorry , this is the only one we can give you .	sure , we have something much cheaper .	it depends on your type of car .

really ? well , i guess i have to get used to it .	well ok . i'm in a hurry anyway .	that's too bad because the windows are really dirty . do you have a window cleaning brush so i can do it ?	fine . can you then just fill the car up . i'd appreciate that anyway .	let me back up the car . at least the tank will be full . thanks .
mary , can i get josh or you something to drink ?	you too ! i've missed you guys	when was the last time we saw each other ?	i was so happy to see you	hopefully , you guys can come back soon !

everyone is doing great . my sister finally had her baby .	our family is doing very well .	the family is staying quite busy .	my family is getting ready for our vacation .	my family is getting ready for the kids graduation .
so find a guy to marry and you can get one !	i'm being sarcastic	i'm sorry , that was too much	are you overreacting ?	i'm just kidding
i don't need a guy to buy a wedding ring !	why can't you just enjoy looking at rings with me ?	i probably will get married one day . what's wrong with you ?	you're sure in a bad mood .	okay , i get it . want to go do something else ?
oh , i see . you're going to wear one and pretend you're married to try to attract guys .	you're right , get any ring that you like .	that's true , although i wouldn't wear it on my ring finger .	true , maybe you'll find a nice woman instead .	no , but people will look at you weirdly for wearing a wedding ring .
it's very simple actually . you can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . they will give you a call if any job comes up .	you should start with working on your resume .	you need to update your resume to make sure everything is recent .	you should know what type of job you want .	you should take an online skills test to find out what suits you .
good . i'll do it .	that sounds really great i will give it a try .	thanks so much for letting me know i bet it will work for me too .	how long did it take for them to call you about a job ?	i will definitely try it and hopefully it will work out as well for me as it did for you .
no wonder people say	it's a nice place , i can see why	gulliners ?	you're right , i will	will you join me ?
quick ! pass me your binoculars . look at that bird . . . i've never seen one of those before . it's indigenous to guiling , and an endangered species too . this is lucky !	no wonder people say . . . ?	what were you going to say ?	were you going to compliment the guiliners ?	what ? i didn't hear the last of what you said .
i didn't know you liked bird - watching .	wow , so glad you are with me to point this out .	this is so exciting .	i think i need to start keeping a diary of what i see up here .	this is just the best !
i don't really . i just like wildlife , and you don't get to see too much of it in the city . this place is full of it .	yes its	i ’ve loved birds all of my life	as a kid , i spent hours watching the birds that visited my back yard .	it ’s really easy to attract birds to your garden
some game ! you try being tackled by ten kids at once !	they think it's a game . i'm just trying to get away !	these kids are relentless !	i was trying to escape . next time , come help me !	no , i really need to get away for a little while .
um , holly ? look behind you . they're coming this way .	good thing you're big and strong .	lol , there's danger in being too popular .	you're great , thanks for not giving away you're not real .	you're the # 1 bunny in my book !
oh , where to start ? there have been ups and downs . i'm still trying to find my place in this world . it's only recently that i've been able to start settling down . how about you ? you still with jenn	great ! life couldn't be better .	life is all that i ever dreamed about .	well , you know , you take the lumps and bumps in stride .	overall , i'd say , great !
yeah , jenny and i got married right after graduation . it was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . i was supporting us both while she continued her studies . but now things are getting better	which place do you choose	yes i'm with her	what about you	nice to hear
oh , that sounds wonderful . i have always known you two would make it . i hope i can keep in better contact with you guys . i don't want us to drift apart again .	that's really good to hear .	i'm glad you are working through things .	that sounds like things are improving which is nice .	i'm happy you could work through the hard times .
definitely ! actually , we just moved into a new place . there's a house - warming party this saturday , if you are free ? i know jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party .	it would be nice to hang out more .	yeah i would love to keep in touch	it's always hard when people move away	we should make plans to meet up
sounds great ! i'll be there .	that would be fun , i would love to come .	i should check my schedule to make sure i am free .	do you mind if i bring someone with me ?	we can catch up on old times .
i've been packed for a week . all my stuff is in this backpack .	i think its not necessary for this trip	enjoy nature is ultimate goal right	k	get readt
let me see . . . two books . . . birdseed ?	what did you pack ?	how much did you pack ?	i packed only a few items .	will you be able to carry everything ?
that's trail mix !	yeah we aren't supposed to bring much	what more could i need ?	i want to see the different birds	i like bird watching
same difference . what's this ?	what is trail mix ?	i hate trail mix	it looks like birdseed to me	that's the only food you brought ?
and we have some squabbles on some boring things .	yes , and we still argue about money .	being rich means we spend much less time together .	she has so many hobbies that she doesn't have time for me .	we stay so busy that we never see each other .
this is ordinary marriage life .	like what kind of squabbles ?	perhaps you should try to talk about it ?	maybe try counseling ?	maybe you need more excitement in your life
have you talk to him about it ?	ugh , that sounds awful	have you tried talking to him ?	i had a cousin like that , he shaped up after he got kicked out though	what a jerk
not yet , but i have to soon . he's eating me out of house and home . i caught him reading the fridge again last night	yeah , he just snaps at me .	no , he would just complain .	he thinks he doesn't have to do anything .	he would just laugh at me .
ahahah , maybe that will help you lose weight .	i am sure if you bring it up , it will change .	it sounds like he needs a talking to .	yeah , i think you need to sit down with him .	talk to him right away for sure .
this is no laughing matter , nick .	i'm glad you can joke about it .	that's true , and my doctor might give me a clean bill of health .	i just wish he would leave me some food for breakfast .	this is the last time i let him stay .
sorry paul . i couldn't help it . so why doesn't he give you a hand ?	of course it is , i'm not involved !	it's a solid diet idea .	i laughed at it at least .	lighten up , please .
he watch the tob too much . now really i don't know . but i can't handle this much longer .	he's a lazy jerk	i don't know , he just refuses	he ignores me when i ask	i think it's a problem with his foot
well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , ok ?	maybe you should just kick him out .	just because he's related doesn't mean you should put up with it .	maybe you should give him specific chores to do .	you definitely should talk to him about it .
no , i don't like museums . they're boring .	that sounds like it would be fun .	what are the hours there ?	can i take pictures in there ?	are there really new exhibits ?
why don't you go to see the empire state building ?	really ? what don't you like ?	really ? i love them !	why don't you like them ?	what's wrong with them ?
ah ! that sounds interesting .	no , i don't like heights at all .	how much does it cost to get in ?	is there a long line of people there usually ?	tell me about something else in new york that isn't so tourist .
yes , that's what i need .	yes , thank you	does he require a lot of writing ?	i was wondering if there was a lot of reading	no i was wondering how often he gave tests
he is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . are you willing to study hard ?	well , he grades on the bell curve .	he insists you participate in class .	he's tough but fair .	i think you'll learn a lot from him .
yes , i guess so .	yes , i like to study hard .	i don't really like to study that much .	is it really that necessary to study ?	i prefer to study all at the last minute .
what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ?	then you'll be fine	that's good , you should be okay	as long as you apply yourself you'll be fine , then	you guess so ?
yes , i had a teacher like that before .	yes , that makes for a great teacher .	that is my favorite kind of teacher .	oh yes , i hate it when they're mean .	i do , sounds like i would enjoy his class .
did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ?	really ? where ?	in college or high school ?	in high school ?	where at ?
no , i didn't , but that could be a good thing .	no , i had no idea .	i wasn't aware of that , no .	i didn't know that .	that's a lot of experience . so , he's good then , right ?
well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . good luck !	did you know he's also written several books ?	did you know he's considered an expert in his field of teaching ?	did you know he also taught overseas for several years ?	did you know he also volunteers for another school on the weekends ?
the doctors and the nurses will help you . and i will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby .	what do you think we should name it ?	i want you to be happy for us and our baby .	are you worried we won't love you anymore ?	can we help you not feel so nervous ?
thank you , dear . i feel better now .	thanks , hon	i'm just scared , i guess . what if something goes wrong	i'm glad you'll be here	i hope everything goe sokay
i saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .	nope , unfortunately	i think in a couple days	i heard it may last all week	nope , let's check the weather together
that sucks so much . what are we going to do ?	i don't think i can take it for another eight days .	we'll need to build an ark .	i hope it won't flood .	i hate that , my yard is already waterlogged .
i'm getting pretty bored . we should do something despite the rain .	we can just make other plans .	let's just find stuff indoors .	i think we can just find something else to do .	i am sure we can find an indoor activity .
i'm with you . what do you have in mind ?	yeah , we should . what is everyone else up to ?	me too . i'm bored out of my mind . let's get out of here .	where do you want to go ?	let's see what everyone else is up to and make a plan .
i haven't been to the mall in a long time . let's go there .	how about bowling ?	what do you say we go catch a movie ?	do you want to go out to eat ?	what do you think of going to the flea market ?
that sounds good . they have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie .	sounds good to me	i vote we drive , due to the rain	okay , but i need to be back by 8	what if we went to the movies instead ?
great . i'll stop by your place now .	oh , yeah , we could see a movie !	do you know what is playing ?	we can eat at the food court .	we should check the listings before we go .
ok . don't forget to bring your umbrella . the rain can start up again anytime .	cool i'll have the door unlocked	ok i'll go get ready	see you soon	can't wait to see you
he's the love of my life ! i've really messed this up .	i guess so . but still - what if he is ? then that would mean he doesn't really care about me .	it's still wrong . i don't know . should i call him ?	i don't think it matters , because it would prove where he stands . should i break up with him for good ?	i know , but i guess i really care for him more than i thought . do you think i should get back together with him ?
come on , hon . pull yourself together . it's going to be alright .	then go to him ! tell him !	that's on you , you just have to try your best to deal with it and hope it works out	that's rough , i'm sorry	it'll be okay , just try to relax
but i . . . i still love him ! and it's all my fault ! i can't believe how immature and selfish i was being . i mean , he is a firefighter , it's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . i've totally messed this up !	i don't want him to see other people .	i want to call him and get back together .	maybe he doesn't even like me anymore .	i should just go see him .
you know what , veronica , i think you should make the first step . i'm sure he'll forgive you . . .	well why don't you try calling him ?	i'm sure everything is ok .	he's probably just been busy .	maybe you should go see him
no , this is not gon na happen ! i . . . i've ruined everything . . .	i think you're right i should call him .	but he is the man , i think he should make the first move .	i don't know , i don't want to seem desperate .	i have to do something . i don't want to lose him .
do you hear something ?	you don't know that , you have to try	even if you did so what ?	yeah , you did . sucks , but you got ta move on	i think you should still try , it can't hurt
wait a minute , you mean you met her online ?	that's awesome , i am glad you have a date .	aww man , i really wanted to hang out .	do you want to do something this weekend .	cool , i hope you have a great time !
yeah ! i signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! you fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat .	yes i did	yeah , why ?	didn't i mention that before ?	yeah , she's great
that is kind of weird ! what if she is a psycho or something like that ?	how do you know what she said is the truth ?	are you going to be disappointed if she turns out to be the opposite of what she said online ?	are you certain this is a good way to meet a girl ?	why don't you try the old fashioned way of meeting girls ?
it's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! i am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! i think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy .	we've been chatting now for 3 months . i don't think she's a psycho .	oh , c'mon . don't be mean just because i have a date and can't hang out with you .	well , she didn't check the psycho box in her profile .	we'll be meeting in a cafe downtown , so i think things will be fine .
i guess it does seem logical . i'll have to check it out !	i don't think it sounds safe .	she could be any kind of weirdo .	what if she's really some big dude ?	you should let me know where you meet .
it has been a pleasure . goodbye .	it was very lovely being your guest .	it was very nice of you to invite me over .	i wish i could stay longer , but i can't break this obligation .	perhaps i can come around again once i get back from my trip ?
goodbye . thank you again for coming .	thanks so much for thinking of me .	i hope you have a nice dinner !	don't be such a stranger !	it's been so great seeing you .
you know i work with my professional knowledge not passion . sometimes i don't know what the meaning of working is ?	like what ?	how much longer do we have to endure this ?	what would you like to do ?	no we can't , we're stuck here
but you did a good job . you always perform the best in our company .	i know what you mean , it's tough .	have you looked for anything else ?	i hope you can find something you love .	it sounds like it's time for a change .
yes , that's in the past . maybe i need to go to my psychologist for help .	but is it really worth it ?	i know but i just hate it	i just wish i enjoyed it more	i want to do something else
perhaps you've just tired and you need a vacation .	maybe , if you think it would help .	i think we just need to do something different for a change .	i think you should go see someone .	maybe you should look for a new job .
i was full of ambitions before . but now i have no aim for my career .	we could go somewhere really relaxing like the beach .	i don't know if i can stop thinking about this on a vacation .	i probably need some good sleep .	maybe i should try working in a different department .
maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting .	it sounds like you really need a vacation .	maybe you should take some time off of work .	try taking it easy for a little while .	have you considered looking for a new job ?
that sounds interesting . but i don't know how to do that .	i think i am beyond that now .	have you thought of an alternative career ?	could this have something to do with our relationship ?	are you feeling trapped ? is that it ?
how about a training course ?	reading new books	meeting new people	i'm not sure , let's discover together	i don't know either
a training course ? that must be costly .	that could be interesting	did you have any in mind ?	how would we do that ?	what kind of training ?
but it's worth it . maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future .	i think it would be worth it .	but it would help with things .	it would be a great thing to do .	i want to do it anyway .
ok , let's have a try .	that'd be good , yeah	is there anything else we could do ?	hmmm , we could always do something else then	true ! i'd love to do something like that
ok .	i'm glad you're open to doing something .	i really think it would be good for you .	i will help you look for something when we get home .	we should look online for something recommended .
yes , i liked it , too . it was exciting , but not over the top . do you know what i mean ?	i thought it was amazing , great action .	i though it was pretty good , i liked the acting .	it was an okay movie , could of had more action .	i loved the movie , the actor who plays bond is amazing .
mmm . that's what i thought too . i really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . and i always enjoy watching pierce brosnan .	yeah , i agree , it was really cool , though .	i liked the movie because it was more up to date .	i hope they make another one soon .	what did you like about it ?
oh , yes . he's brilliant . did you like the title song ?	pierce brosnan is a good actor .	the opening sequence was really cool !	i completely forgot the car chase .	i might watch the movie again soon .
not as much as last time , actually . what's the name of the american actor who was in the supporting role ?	pierce is the bomb isn't he ?	the car chase got my heart pumping .	it was exciting and very well filmed .	i loved the title song . i'm going to buy it online .
hum , edward norton , or something like that . did you like him ?	i do nt know	whoever he is , he's handsome	i'm really not sure to be honest	maybe it's justin long
yes . he was excellent . they worked well together , don't you think ?	yeah i always think he's great	he was good . did you like him ?	i've like him since fight club . have you seen that ?	he played the role very well
i don't know . i think the woman was better . she provided a good love interest . lucky james bond !	i think everyone worked well together .	i can't believe how into it i was .	it kept my interest the whole time .	i really love the acting .
yes !	yeah , lucky guy	he always gets the girl , ya know ?	i'd love to have his life	i wish i could be a secret agent
you can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you needn't pay for it .	it's about as much as the cost of a cd really	nah , it's not that much	it's pretty cheap , especially give you get all songs	i'm not sure , i don't listen to music
i have downloaded one , but it still can't be listened .	isn't that stealing ?	is that legal ?	i thought you had to pay to listen ?	isn't it only free if there are ads ?
in order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software .	maybe there's a technical issue .	you should try again .	tell me the steps you took .	i'll try to help you .
can you recommend some to me ?	i have said software	what is the software ?	where do i get the software ?	why ?
certainly . realplayer is a good .	i need to know what kind of computer you have .	you should do some research online .	i think itunes is a good music service .	what type of computer are you using for the music ?
can i download it ?	isn't that a bit old ?	isn't that an older one ?	i didn't know it was still around .	i didn't know that existed still .
yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it .	it's probably already there , i'll show you how to find it .	yes , it's a pretty easy download .	i'm not sure . let's search it online .	yes . let me help you download it .
i'll try it tonight .	will it be easy to find after i download ?	will it be in a normal format ?	i hope i can figure this out .	will it be easy to use ?
but , you were born and raised in california !	what an insensitive question	why would he ask that	what did you say ?	 . . . . what a jerk
yeah , but i get that sometimes . it doesn't matter how many generations my family has lived in the u . s . , we'll always be foreigners in their eyes .	yeah , that's why i was so upset	i'm so tired of racist comments .	guess he didn't think so	i guess i don't look like it
what a racist ! how can you stand working with the guy ?	he shouldn't be rude to you .	he can be such a jerk .	don't let his attitude get to you .	you are a great person .
you know , richard isn't such a bad guy . he made the comment out of ignorance , not malice .	i can't , but what can i do ?	i leave crap on his chair	i don't have a choice	i'm leaving soon , that's hwo
so , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn english ?	at least you don't hold it against him .	he still should be more aware of what he says .	i think he needs to watch what he says .	i'm glad you handled it in such a good way .
i told him 28 years . and , he knows i'm 28 years old since i just celebrated my birthday last week . he was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it .	i said i am still learning .	i told him 1 year .	about 2 years ,	i told him 3 years .
are you sure he really got the message ?	oh man ! did he get embarrassed ?	i hope that helped his ignorance a little bit .	what did he say once he got it ?	did he apologize ?
yeah , i'm pretty sure since i then asked him how long it took him to learn english .	yeah , he was nice about it after that .	i think so .	he was a little weird about it .	he didn't seem to be mean about it .
that's hilarious ! what did he say ?	what did he say ?	and what was his response ?	if i was you , i'd stay away from him for a while .	how did he react ?
he said ,'36 years ,'and we both laughed about it . he apologized and now , it's all good .	he said he was just joking .	he said he was just joking .	he apologized and asked if he could buy me a coffee for his ignorance .	he said he didn't realize and thought i was born in another country . he laughed and said yea i am stupid sometimes .
i'm glad . i bet he won't make that mistake again .	well i'm glad it worked out	you took it much better than i would have .	it's good you could laugh about it	hopefully he learned his lesson

first of all , we'll design a custom - made work - out plan according to your habits .	we provide many pieces of equipment	many things , what are you interested in	a personal trainer	dietician and support staff
how can you get that done ?	oh , that sounds good . tell me more about it .	do you offer personal trainers ?	does it include a diet plan ?	how many days a week will i need to go to the gym ?
well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . and he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work - out plan for your needs .	just come into my office for a meeting .	contact my assistant and she can schedule you in	you can go online and fill out a personality test and we can match you with a plan from there .	we can go over some questions over the phone or face to face and i'll get started on your profile .
what else ?	what about a diet ?	how intense are he workouts ?	do people usually stick to the plan ?	i have been needing to get in better shape .
since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal .	we will also create a diet plan that fits your needs that you follow .	you can meet with the personal trainer four times a week .	we will track your progress and indicate where you can improve .	if you are not satisfied with the results after 2 months then we will give you a refund .
sounds pretty good . what about the charge ?	great ! i am looking forward to it .	i don't want to be too sore after doing the exercises .	how long do you think it will take me to get in shape ?	are your trainers certified ?
that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year .	we have many different options . your trainer will recommend one that fits you best .	we charge $ 35 monthly , or you can save 30 % by paying for a whole year .	that depends . will you just be working out ? or will you be using the pool , too ?	it's $ 20 a month for a single person . but it's $ 40 a month for a family pass .
maybe one month . just have a try first . not too tough at the beginning .	ok . sounds good . thank you .	i will have to think about it and decide which membership to purchase .	sign me up for the one month membership .	i'm not sure i can commit to one year .
wise decision . you'll find it's totally worth it .	ok . we can handle that .	i think that is a wise decision .	you may find paying for 6 months will motivate you to stick with it .	you know what they say - no pain no gain .
no . i'm a sophomore . i take it you are a new student ?	yes , i am .	i am new . i am a little nervous about meeting new people .	i am . would you like to take a walk around campus ?	i am . where is your dorm ?

i'm from korea . my parents wanted me to go to an american university , so i came here .	i am from kansas . i'm used to lots of homework .	i intend to balance work and play .	i think school should be a combination of social and eduction .	where are you from ?

why were you in japan ?	korea is very different from japan .	i have never been to japan either . i am from seoul .	where are you from ?	you should visit korea . it is a beautiful place .
my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . he's so into learning about different cultures .	i went on vacation with my family .	i did an internship there .	i was an exchange student .	my mom was stationed there for 2 years .
that's pretty cool .	what did your father think of japan ?	i've never been to japan . what was it like ?	vacation and studying seem like very different ways to learn .	did you enjoy it as well ?
i thought it would have been more fun if i went without my parents .	yeah , it is . and it's cool that you're here going to school !	i enjoyed that vacation ; he's right about visiting different places .	thanks . maybe i'll mention korea to him for next time !	i guess we're both travelers !
well , if you ever want to visit korea , i would be happy to show you around .	what would you have done differently ?	why , what was wrong with them ?	why , so you could go around getting up to trouble ?	it couldn't have been that bad though .
thanks for the offer . i'll keep that in mind . oh , the professor is coming . we'll talk more after class .	having a native - born guide would be really awesome !	thanks ! why don't you let me show you around here , which is what i can do for you now .	so , you'd be ok if i just showed up in korea ?	exotic foreign vacations , with the student debt i'm building up , vacations will mean camping for the next 10 years !
ok .	i can't wait !	is he a nice professor ?	oh no ! my pen is out of ink . can i borrow one ?	sounds good !
i think i must report to the cops .	did you actually know him as a boy ?	yep , that's the one . i saw him at the gas station .	i know ! i was terrified !	yes . and he looks even more creepy in person .
ok .	yeah . that's a good idea .	where did you see him ?	what does he look like , just in case i see him .	yes . i would call the cops as soon as possible .
hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? isn't it hideous ?	so which one should i pick ?	i have another option here too .	which one do you like the most ?	which one looks the most expensive ?
i guess .	yes , pretty bad .	well , it was made with love .	i wouldn't wear it !	i think you can pull off wearing it !
are you even listening ? i'm trying to have a conversation with you .	you guess . . . it's yours if you want it !	i have to throw it out .	there's literally no way i could ever wear this outside !	what do you mean ? ! it's horrible ! ! ! !
and i'm trying to watch the game , but you're yapping on about your new clothes !	you know i'm not really interested in talking about clothes .	i'm sorry . i'm just really distracted right now .	of course i'm listening . just go with the other one that i said wasn't too flashy .	don't be like that . maybe i like the sweater from your aunt .
well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon !	that's mean !	i can't believe you !	i'm going to give you 5 seconds to reevaluate what you just said .	you realize that this isn't going to end well for you , right ?
well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it's the third quarter and you've been blabbering on since the first !	hey , you don't hear me complaining about what gifts to exchange .	that sounds like a personal problem to me .	and i'm trying to decide on what pizza toppings to order before half time .	maybe it'll be quieter once you're at the sales .
oh , your precious game . you watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals !	okay then . i'll just make my own choices !	i thought you'd like to give your opinion . sorry to get in the way of your precious game .	if you'd just pay attention , we would have been doing long before .	fine ! i'll stop asking what you think .
oh no you didn't . you didn't just insult the sals - bury seals , did you ? why don't you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ?	this is their year though !	i don't say anything about the stuff you like .	my team is great this year !	not this year .
i might just ! enjoy your stupid game !	maybe i should return more than just clothes , maybe i should trade in my husband while i'm about it !	maybe you should think about what's important in your life and ignore all the frivolous diversions .	the seals are a perennial disappointment , i don't know why you waste your time on that .	a loser following a losing team , apropos .
it must have really hurt afterwards .	i'm glad it wasn't serious , and glad it went well .	are you home now ?	well that's nice to know . did you ever see that movie where the guy was under anesthetic but basically awake during surgery ?	well at least it's all over now .
well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . i wasn't permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . that was the worse thing .	not as much as you'd think . the anaesthetic took a long time to wear off afterwards .	not with all the pain medication they prescribed me , it didn't .	the pain wasn't as annoying as having to watch what i ate .	it did hurt , especially if i stood up for too long , but only for a few weeks .
i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital .	that sounds horrible .	you must have been so hungry !	well , i'm glad that you're better now .	and you're feeling all better now ?
i certainly was ! however , the doctor gave me a list of food i couldn't eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list !	not really . everything was still sore , so i had to pick something a little easier to start with .	pretty much , but heavier foods like steak did have to wait until i got out . i was still pretty out of it from the anesthetic once i woke up , so there was no way i could have chewed on one for very long at all .	as soon as the doctors gave their approval , i was all for it .	yes , but i was on a strict post - surgery diet to make sure everything healed up like it was supposed to .
is there any pain now ?	that's too bad . i hope you're back to eating everything now .	bummer . that first steak must have tasted wonderful .	that really is the worst ! sorry you had to go through all that .	oh no ! what else was on the list ?
no , not at all . i stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days .	a little but i feel much better now .	yeah , just a bit though .	sometimes i do , but i think it is mostly gone .	well i'm hungry , so there is that .
did they take good care of you in the hospital ?	laparoscopic surgery doesn't do as much damage as the old fashioned kind .	doctors are really leary about giving people painkillers these days .	that really good to hear .	is there any chance the condition could come back ?
oh , yes . the nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what i could drink . in the end , i just drank water and nothing else . everyone was very professional and i actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay .	as good as they could . i was really uncomfortable .	they tried . but i think i was a little cranky with the nurses .	the nurses were really great , but the doctor was a little dismissive .	yes , they did . but i'm glad to be out now !
go ahead . it's nothing serious . we are good friends , aren't we ?	well , begin from the beginning .	that's alright . just tell me what you can .	should i be sitting down for this ?	it will be alright . go ahead and tell me about it .
yes , of course . but i'm afraid i can't tell you .	i have to cancel our golf game this weekend .	i'm afraid that i broke the lawn mower that you lent to me .	i accidentally dinged your car when i got out of mine .	i'm sorry to have to do this to you , but i need you to work this weekend .
thank you .	thank you jack . what have you arranged to discuss ?	i appreciate it . shall we get this meeting started ?	of course , thank you . i know you're very busy , so don't let me keep you .	thank you . what can i do for you this afternoon ?
since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter , your fortunes are falling . bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . be careful .	let me flip the page and check .	for taurus it says that jupiter is in retrograde -- whatever that means-- but then it says that you will meet a charming stranger next month .	okay sure , which month is gemini ?	i'll skip the part about the planets , but the prediction for gemini is that you will receive great riches that will test your relationships with others .
that sounds bad ! i'm really worried , what should i do ? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day .	ok , i will watch my step today .	i just read it for the entertainment . i don't actually believe it .	you can't be too careful . thanks for the heads - up .	do you really follow the advice ?
but we have a date tonight ! you can't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope .	i wouldn't worry so much about it . i mean maybe your team is gon na lose today , while that stinks it's not the end of the world .	i would just enjoy your day , if something is going to happen it's going to happen .	don't worry about it , these things are for fun anyway .	yes ! go home and stay inside and be careful . you don't want to risk it !
nothing . just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . we'll bring everything .	no need to bring anything other than yourself !	if you could bring some bread rolls , that would be great .	any chance you could bring a bottle of wine ?	some chips or maybe some soda would be great !
yes , i do . i know a place that has excellent food .	yes , that new one .	how about italian ?	i like mexican .	when do you want to go ?
ok . i'll be happy to join you .	i trust your judgement so make reservations wherever you think is best .	great ! i look forward to having dinner with you tomorrow .	what type of cuisine does the restaurant serve ?	as long as it isn't mexican cuisine , i am fine . my stomach doesn't agree with mexican food .
you speak really well .	how many classed did you take in college for it ?	is it hard to learn as a second language ?	how hard is it to learn as a language ?	did you take any english classes in high scchool ?
thank you .	thank you !	i appreciate your affirmation . it means a lot to me .	i made learning english a priority because i wanted to date jan .	learning english has opened up so many doors for me .
how long have you been in the u . s . ?	how long have you been in the united states ?	was it difficult to learn english ?	do you have friends you can have english conversations with ?	you have a very small accent- i can hardly tell you aren't a native english speaker .
3 weeks .	i have been here for several years .	i have been here for less than a year .	not very long actually !	about four years , i came to the u .s for college .
is your wife with you ?	so how are you enjoying it so far ?	have you settled in , or are things still crazy ?	how was your flight over to the states ?	have you been able to converse with americans smoothly ?
yes , she just got here yesterday .	not yet , she's coming over next month .	yes , she just joined me last night .	yes , she flew over with me when i came	no . she will not be joining me at this time . we are trying to figure out her timeline .
have you been to california before ?	that's great news , welcome !	i hope she enjoys her stay .	does she speak english ?	i would love to meet her .
no . i've never been there .	no i have not been yet	no , but i really want to go !	yes i have been there once or twice	yes , i was actually there last month
have you ever been to las vegas ?	california has a lot of tourist attractions that you need to check out .	you have got to go around the corner on first street and try their deep dish pizza .	the state has so many things to do there , it is endless attractions .	i would go to california and visit before you go home .
yes . i went there once on a business trip .	i haven't been there yet .	yes , and it was great !	i'd love to go .	i do not want to go there ever .
what can i do for you ?	what can i do to help ?	anything for a friend , let me know what to do .	what is wrong ?	sure i will help you , what do you want me to do ?
i am looking for an article in a newspaper .	can you help me with some chores	can you help me move ?	i need you to pick me up	i want to ask if you can loan me money
did you check the periodicals ?	there are many articles on file in the back if you would like to wait .	i can search the database for you and see what we have .	what particular article are you looking for ?	do you know what the title of the article is ?
i didn't even bother to think of that .	i haven't checked them yet .	yes , i took a look at them .	yes , i took a look at them .	the periodicals didn't have what i needed .
i'll show you where to find your article .	yeah , don't forget to check those .	don't forget .	it can be easy to forget those .	yeah .
i get lost in this library .	great . thank you .	apparently i can take all the help i can get .	that would be very much appreciated .	you're too kind . thanks .
it's right this way .	so what we will	have you get shortly	not like that we will arrange that	we will meet shortly
thanks a lot for your help .	which way is the library though ?	ok , thank you .	can i view the article online instead ?	are you sure the periodical is in the library ?
i'm afraid i can't before i finish this project .	i have way too much work to do .	i have way too much work to do .	i am thinking about taking time off in june	maybe after this big project is over .
you'd better pay more attention to your health .	you should still have time ?	take a break first !	you deserve a break to be honest .	the timing is so bad !
i will , thanks for your concern .	i know , but as soon as this project is done then things will get easier .	i am just trying to finish this project first .	i know . i plan on taking some time off after this project is done .	thanks for worrying , but i think i can handle it .
you're welcome .	maybe you should change your diet up and that will help .	i'd suggest starting with trying to eat healthier .	no problem . i'm just worried about you .	it's important to keep your health in mind , above all else .
it was the police wo helped me to do that .	i had them announce him on the speaker !	i just looked around the whole store .	i screamed and screamed until he came back .	i asked people for help .
it must have taught you a lesson this time .	wow , at least you found him !	is he safe ?	so you found him ?	yikes .
i am not running after the fashion . i just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen .	it's not that i'm running after the fashion . i think our kitchen is really outdated .	our appliances are outdated and barely working .	it's not running after the fashion as much as it's fixing the problems of our kitchen .	the kitchen has too many problems not to be updated .
thank you for your compliments . it sounds like you're a clothing expert .	it is spring now so i think i will explore vairous colors .	i already have a lot of black clothes , so i may try something bright .	i'm not a huge fan of pink clothes .	anything but orange , not a flattery color .
well , compared with my wife , i'm just a beginner .	i'm more of a clothing enthusiast .	i do enjoy learning about clothing styles .	people tell me that all the time !	i love studying clothing trends and styles .
we don't have a national day .	do you like to go to the events ?	what is the biggest parade that you have seen ?	is there live animals involved ?	are there any community designed floats ?
really ? that's unusual .	that's a shame . it's a really great time to get together with people .	i wonder why ? your country probably has a rich history .	sorry to hear that ! maybe some day your country will adopt one .	it's such a great time , sorry that you don't have one . i will be thinking about your country for you during our celebrations !
i guess it is . most countries have on , but we don't .	yeah , most countries have that .	yeah , i thought it was strange and unusual too .	yeah .	we still have pride though .
actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . in the evening , many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day .	yes , i thought all countries had that holiday .	well , you have lots of other holiday with parades , right ?	you can come with me to my country's parade if you want .	well , parades are sometimes boring anyway , they are very long .
how about your mother ?	wow , that's far .	ok , let me know what happens .	ok , how about next time ?	what about your mother ?
my mother died two years ago .	she lives in virginia .	my mother is no longer with us . she died last year .	i don't speak to my mother anymore .	she lives in hawaii , so i don't see her very often . but we talk on the phone .
oh , i am sorry to hear that . is your father still working ?	what are all your weekend plans	how many days work on this field	what is your hobby	which program you like on the tv
no , he's retired .	no , he's retired .	he retired but still freelances .	yes , he's a teacher .	he's between jobs right now .
do you have any family here ?	does he do any extracurricular activities ?	is he lonely because your mother passed away ?	what did he do for a living ?	does he enjoy being retired ?
yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here .	yes	yes i have two child	yes i have father	no additional family
do you have any brothers or sisters ?	do you ever meet up with them ?	are you close with those relatives ?	how often do you get to see them ?	how long does it take to travel to d .c . to see your dad ?
yes , i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston .	no , i'm an only child .	yes , i actually live with my brother .	would you believe i have 12 brothers and sisters ?	i have one of each .
do you see them a lot ?	do you see them often ?	i'd love to meet your siblings sometime .	having a big family is amazing .	are you close to your family ?
not as much as i'd like to . usually just on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas .	not really . . . we should get together more often though .	yes , we make a point of getting together every year .	no , because we are all on different schedules and scattered around the country .	we typically see each other at weddings and funerals and special occasions .
oh , cheer up . he'll understand you .	where is he going ?	why is he leaving ?	aw , i'm sure he understands why you couldn't be there .	why couldn't you see him when he left ?
i hope so .	what is the problem for u	your friend so good but you have some missunderstanding	don't confuse think about clear	take it easy
i don't know . a friend of mine said i should try it .	yes	mexican usage	i have basic insttrucation	good
do you know where a moroccan restaurant is ?	it sounds too adventurous for me .	were you hoping to get more information from me about the cuisine ?	if it's anything like thai or indian , then i would be interested .	i should look it up when i get home .
as a matter of fact , he gave me this address .	i heard that there's one in pittsburgh .	my friend said there's a new one across town .	i don't think there's one around here , but i can look for recipes online .	i'm not sure . i'll ask my friend !
let's go there for lunch ! i'm up for an adventure !	let's go tonight to try it !	let me know when you are going and i will join you .	sounds good , let me know when we can go .	do you want to try it together ?
no . it was the only dish she wasn't good at . so we could use you as the new head chef . . .	it has a nice zest to it that her fettucini didn't .	i am being completely serious with you .	i love how creamy it is .	maybe you have a better recipe than she did .
oh , uncle giovanni . that's wonderful ! thank you ! thank you !	thanks , but i love my job !	wow , thank you ! i'd be honored .	oh wow , i was looking for a new job !	that sounds like a great opportunity . tell me more !
ok , ok . get back to work . there's someone waiting for you in the kitchen . . .	i've been waiting for the right time to tell you .	i am so proud of you , nicole .	so you accept the position , right ?	congratulations , nicole , we can't wait for you to start
no , i don't think so . she said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage .	they might , we can wait and see !	i think that they probably will become reconciled .	they definitely won't become reconciled .	what does reconciled mean ?
what a shame ! their marriage is really a mistake .	wow .	she seems angry !	maybe they are better divorced .	yikes .
but you look quite proficient in using them now .	do you have a problem with chopsticks ?	you could bring along a spoon !	you could try and use the chopsticks with your hands !	what else is bad about the place ?
certainly . after all , i've been here for two years . it's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils . though , i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a ch	it's still hard .	i've been practicing .	thank you .	yes , i'm getting quite good now !
yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm i	i wonder if there are any websites that address that .	i worry about that too .	do you go to them often ?	do you have anyone you could ask ?
anything strang about that ?	what seems like a rude one ?	we all have to eat , we just do it differently .	it takes time to get used to local traditions and mannerisms , but we are all the same .	well , the main thing is to try to do your best to keep an open mind about it .
maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present .	not much	i find that strange .	do you find it usual ?	i did not mean bad
oh , sorry ! there's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks .	yes , i definitely wish that i had known that information .	this would have never occurred to me . i have probably offended many people .	even after two years , i did not realize that . i will place them horizontally next time .	that is helpful to know . thank you for correcting the gesture .
i agree .	yeah , most people are jerks .	people suck .	some people are just nasty !	not everyone will agree with you .
this city is full of jerks .	people stink .	what do you do instead ?	i've really turned into a loner .	yeah . i'd rather just chill at home .
rude people are everywhere .	yes it is , but there's good folk too .	well , i just try to avoid them because the city itself is okay .	can you tell me any jerks in particular ?	i'm sorry you don't enjoy it here .
but what can you do ?	sorry about the experience .	what have they done to you ?	you must be having a bad day	do not mind them
you can yell at them .	move to another city !	just smile at them , i guess .	be rude back .	precisely . that's why i don't go outside .
and they will yell back at you .	or we could just ignore them .	there's got to be some place where we can just meet good people .	is there any good people left ?	it's so hard to find polite , nice people now - a - days .
yelling doesn't do any good .	you might get in a fight too .	what are they gon na about it ?	then i will yell right back .	i don't mind , they are jerks .
no . the best thing to do is just stay home .	yes , i'd rather just ignore them .	this is why i stay inside .	fortunately i can get grocery delivery here .	i'm just glad i can work from home .
well , what's the weather report ?	the news is just so depressing these days .	is there ever any good news in the paper ?	\it's depressing , isn't it ? we need more happy articles in the paper .	that's why i don't even read the paper anymore .
sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow .	it is going to be sunny all week .	i think it is going to rain today .	i didn't get a chance to look .	here , look for yourself .
did they find those bank robbers ?	sounds like today's a better day for a picnic .	well , at least we can enjoy some nice weather today .	the rain will be good for my garden !	sounds like a good balance . thank you !
not yet . they were holding two men in ohio , but they let them go . they weren't the criminals after all .	yes , that was the top news story in there .	no , they have some leads though .	i didn't even see anything about it today .	yes , they caught all three of them last night .
what about the sports page ? what were the scores of last night's games ?	oh gosh , i wonder where the real robbers are ?	i would be so upset if i was apprehended and didn't commit the crime	do you know how much they ended up stealing ?	do you know how long they ended up holding them ?
here's the paper ; you can read them yourself .	your favorite team won it looks like .	i don't know , i don't like sports .	i haven't looked yet .	here you can look at the paper .
but your health is more important . believe me !	we'll make it extra special to make it up to you .	how about we have a small celebration in the hospital and a bigger one later ?	your health is most important so that you have many birthdays to come !	i'll bring your gift to the hospital before your party .
if boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad .	i must be playing all the wrong ones then .	which types are not violent ? what are the names ?	i have not seen any good ones , which ones are they ?	yes , i guess so , but there are too many violent ones .
come on . things are not so bad . boys can learn to use the computer through games .	i disagree , that's not true	i don't think playing video games dictates how a person will become	i think that's pretty big vast over - generalization	what makes you think that ?
oh , no . as a matter of fact , i haven't danced for a long time .	i have been practicing a lot more lately .	i try to dance often , but i don't get to as much as i would like to .	yes , i do . how about you ? do you go often ?	i don't get to go much , that's why i thought i would go this weekend .
but i am told that you dance wonderfully well .	it will be nice to get you back on the dance floor again .	i am sure you will just as good as you ever were .	i have not been dancing in a long while so we can relearn together .	me either ! i guess we can step on each others toes together .
thanks for flattering me . i think you dance a lot , right ?	i used to dance a lot .	i should practice to show you how i dance .	you will see how well i dance .	i wish i could dance more .
no . just occasionally .	not as often as i would like too .	not as often as when i was younger .	no , i kind of have 2 left feet .	i can keep up with the best of them .
what's your favorite dance ?	wanna go dancing with me tonight ?	should we go on a dancing adventure today ?	show me your dancing skills , right now !	wanna watch me dance ?
it's hard to say , but i do love the foxtrot and waltz .	my favorite would be slow dancing .	i prefer dancing in large groups .	my favorite type of dance is to rock and roll music .	i don't really have a favorite .
how about rock'n'roll ?	wow that s great	i like those too	i ca nt wait to see your moves	cool they are great
to tell you the truth , i don't like it . it's too noisy .	who doesn't like dancing to rock music ?	that's really not my style .	i prefer more structured dancing .	i think you're better at that than i am .
and the tango ?	what about salsa then ?	i think you might like tango then .	we can do a slow two step if you like .	i think line dancing is up your alley then .
oh , it's really beautiful , but i just can't do it well .	i do not know that too well	that is my favorite .	i like that a lot	that is my favorite .
don't be so modest . i'm sure you can do it very well . then i'll meet you at six . is that at all right ?	i've never tried .	you probably do it better than me .	let's try something we both haven't done before .	let's find a place to waltz .
ok .	yes , where should we meet ?	how about seven ? i have to work late today .	yes , i'm looking forward to it .	yes , i'm free at six , i'll see you then .
great ! i'm your lucky fellow then .	would you like dinner after the dance ?	i'll be dressed in blue if you want to coordinate your outfit .	i can't wait to see you this evening !	wonderful ! i will see you and your beautiful face then !
what do you usually do with them ?	i am a quiet person myself so you are better at making friends than i am .	how do go about making friends so easily ?	that is an admirable quality to possess .	i hope to become one of your best friends .
we like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music .	we like to go and fly some kites .	sometimes we go swimming !	sometimes we will watch a movie or something like that .	just hanging out and drinking beers .
i'll go by myself then .	is there something else you'd rather do ?	i'm going because there are a few things i need . i'll treat you to lunch if you come with me .	i have to go because i need to get my sister a birthday gift and that's her favorite store . maybe you can help me pick out something for her .	i really want to go . can i convince you to change your mind ?
i live in my uncle's house . he came here ten years ago .	yes mine is too	not yet	maybe but rent is high	trying to find a better neighborhood
what do you think of the local accent here ? has it been causing you any problems ?	oh , do you like it here ?	wow , that s a long time . how long have you been here ?	the is great you have a place to stay with your uncle .	how long have you been staying with your uncle ?
i think it's just a matter of getting used to it .	so far so good .	sometimes it's a little difficult but i will manage .	a few problems here and there but i can understand most people .	i really like the local accent . i'm trying to practice it myself .
i can't agree more .	yea and also learning	i am working on it	it has not been easy on me	it is hard but i am trying
i'm sorry i was such a grouch . it must've been the weather . when it rains i get depressed .	i'm still waking up .	oh no i feel much better now .	i'm not groggy anymore . it's fine .	okay , then it's settled .
forget it . i'll see you at 11:30 am .	that is so sad	sorry about that	you will be well with time	and now its the rain season . should we expect you to get worse ?
are you sure ? i thought i said it was my mother .	would you believe that my grandmother died ?	well , i think i caught her illness .	well , she's actually still sick .	i need to get a little more creative with my excuses .
i don't think so . but it could've been .	well which one was it ?	are you being serious right now ?	i don't think that is very funny .	well , i thought you said your sister was sick .
well . you can trust me this time . my sister is definitely sick . i'm just coming from the hospital . they say she might even die .	well my sister is sick once again . .	well my whole family is sick this time boss . .	i am very sick , i think i might even throw up . .	i have been sick for a whole week , with the diarrhea !
i don't buy your story . try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ?	i am sorry to hear than , hurry in .	i will need you to bring in some documentation to show that .	sorry this is the last one , you are fired .	i hope you are not making that up , that s a terrible thing to say .
i'll do my best .	sure thing	got it	sorry	ill be on time from now on
just try to be a little more punctual in the future .	you really need to show a little more respect for other people's time .	have you ever thought about why you have to make so many excuses ? clearly when you make stuff up you know that the facts mean you're in the wrong .	next time i'll be leaving exactly at the time i said , even if i end up going to the movies by myself .	with all this technology available and you do everything you can to avoid being responsible .
i'm working on it . really !	what is punctual mean ?	i will put all my effort into being on time .	not to worry , i'm on the straight and narrow now .	i can not predict the future , but i will give you my word that being on time is a priority for me .
for example ?	my mother - in - law can be like that too . i sympathize .	that sounds incredibly irritating .	i'm sorry , would you like to go somewhere and forget about her for a while ?	i'm sorry . is there anything i can do to help ?
well , last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there's just nothing can please her .	she always complains about everything .	i tried to talk to her , but she won't listen .	she is always on me about everything .	she never lets anything slide .
no , i can't see that happening . i know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen .	maybe you shouldn't hang out with her on your weekends .	maybe you should order out .	don't invite her into your house then !	maybe she is a vegan ?
it's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids .	ya get to know her	she sucks	already has happened before	trust me it would
my mother - in - law used to do the same thing to us . if it wasn't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun .	as i'm sure her mother criticized her child rearing . it's a vicious circl .	well , parenting these days is not the same as parenting was for her .	she shouldn't criticize anyone , lest she want to be criticized .	you have to draw a line at how to questions your parenting . otherwise she will continue to think it's appropriate and allowed .
you can wear that pretty red dress .	that purple dress that you got last week is adorable .	anything you like , but you must wear those new shoes ?	you look amazing in anything you wear .	how about we go shopping first ?
around six pm .	cool next friday	awesome ! next fri	sweet , & of course . . . sat night	no thank u for coming . . next fri
do you need help setting up or anything ? i don't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it's fun and i have a good eye for decorating .	six pm sounds great , see you then !	what type of present would you like ?	what types of people would i meet ?	how small is this party ?
no . thank you . i can handle it , but thanks for the offer .	sure ! i've done most of it , but come around five and to help with the finishing touches .	thanks for the offer , but my sister has been doing it . she's a little overprotective of her work , if you know what i mean .	no , that's okay . it's just some balloons . i don't want a lot of decorations that will just end up in a landfill somewhere .	i know you do ! i'm sorry i didn't think of it earlier , but it's all done .
ok , i will see you then .	no problem . is there anything you need me to bring ?	no problem . how many people will be there ?	okay , do you need me to pick up some drinks ?	okay , is it alright if i bring a friend ?
great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer .	it is going to be really fun .	i like gift cards hint hint .	i do not need help setting up but can you grab some plastic cups .	this is going to be the best birthday ever .
right .	what about god ?	do you believe in god ?	i think life is predetermined .	i think we all have our time to die

ok . the dragon boat festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named quyuan . on that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river .	i really don't know much more about them .	i would love to .	yeah , lets do it over a cup of coffee .	i would love to . do you want to go to lunch and i can explain there ?
why do people eat rice cakes on that day ?	what are some of quyuan's works ?	tell me why he threw himself into the river .	wow , can you tell me what kinds of boats are racing ?	why was he such a great poet ? did he write anything i would know ?
in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body .	actually , i'm not sure . i grew up doing it so it just comes natural .	not everyone does .	it's just a long held tradition .	it was something that was easily available when the festival first started .
it sounds so moving .	tell me more about quyuan , sounds interesting .	how does eating rice cakes prevent that ?	what about the other festival ?	sounds fun ! what else happens ?
$ 200 ? if they get a hold of your credit card number , you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! i had a friend who . . .	my point remains , protect yourself first .	well what about the amount over 200 .00 you lose ?	still not worth taking the chance .	i still think you are being naive !
what did you watch ?	what was the movie ?	do want me to come over and visit for a while ?	was it a horror movie ?	look out behind you ! just kidding .
i saw the sixth sense . i didn't know it was going to be so scary .	the babadook .	the exorcist . so scary .	the shining . i do every halloween .	hereditary . i knew i shouldn't have watched it alone .
i remember that . it was a great movie . but it was definitely scary .	yikes , i thought that one was pretty scary too .	oh , it wasn't that scary .	i haven't seen that one but now that i know it's scary , i've got to see it .	i'm not going to watch that then , for sure .
if you're not busy , do you want to come over ? i'm afraid to be alone .	yeah , i wasn't expecting it ! i jumped out of my seat !	i know . it was a lot scarier than i expected !	it was good . i definitely need to check out more scary movies !	yeah , really . maybe i shouldn't watch scary movies so late at night . i couldn't sleep well !
sure . i can come over . what should we do ?	sure , i'll be right over .	i can't come right now , but i can come in an hour .	you'll be fine . it's just a movie .	watch a funny movie on tv . it will take your mind off the sixth sense .
how about if we watch a comedy . i need something to get my mind off the frightening images i have from the sixth sense .	let's watch a comedy !	we could play board games .	i made a lasagna -- we could eat that up !	pig out on ice cream and girl talk ?
ok . i'll get ready and leave . i'll see you in about 20 minutes .	sounds like a plan .	ill be there shortly .	we should watch how to lose a guy in 10 days .	we should watch gaurdians of the galaxy .
hurry , ok . it's dark out .	please hurry . i'm really feeling anxious after that movie	that sounds good . just don't be too long as i hate being alone right now .	okay , please be quick . i'm shaking as i sit here .	good . hurry up and get here so i won't be alone .
don't worry , nothings going to happen . i'll be there real soon .	i'll text you when i reach your home .	i'm on the way	any snacks you want me to bring ?	should i rent a movie ?
ok . see you soon .	ok thanks , i feel silly to be scared .	please hurry anyway .	ok i'm going to call and order a pizza for us .	ok sounds good , are you hungry ?
i'm sorry . i know it must have come as a great shock .	i'm very sorry . i have to follow the family's wishes . you will have to return tomorrow .	i'm sorry , we have already cleared up the room and mr . smith is being prepared for the services tomorrow .	i understand . mr . smith isn't in this building anymore though and was moved after the viewing . the funeral is tomorrow and you will be able to see him then .	i'm sorry the family requested no more visitors after the viewing was over as mr . smith will need to be prepared for services tomorrow .
the viewing was for saying goodbye , and i didn't even get that .	i've known him since i was five years old .	i was out of town and just found out he died .	i don't know what i will do without him around .	we meet for coffee every friday morning .
can we walk there ?	okay lets go now .	where are we going to eat ?	i am hungry let's go now .	what will you get to eat ?
it's on the second floor . may i join you ?	yes , actually we can walk , it's very close .	no , but i have my car with me .	yes , it's just down the block .	no , but i have already called an uber so you can ride with me .
of course ! let's go .	yes please .	absolutely !	i'll meet you by the elevators .	i'll stop by your desk .
let's hurry . i'm starving !	sweet ! i recommend the blt .	awesome . thanks for letting me tag along .	sounds good . my treat .	cool . on my way to your desk now .
maybe he is on the way home now .	you have to let him figure it out on his own .	he'll be back when he's ready .	i think you're overreacting . don't get mad at me for saying that .	his phone could be dead . he lost track of time .
the couple with the dogs , think back .	you never remember anything .	how could you forget them ?	they sat with us at dinner .	remember we all drank rum .
no , i don't recall a thing about them .	i can't remember them .	where they an older couple ?	where they doing anything memorable ?	what kind of dogs did they have ?
well , i've invited them for brunch .	they used to walk their dogs on the beach every morning .	they had a little black dog and a brown dog .	remember you petted their little dog and said you wanted one like that .	they bought us a round of drinks the last night we were there .
hmm , i must be getting absent - minded .	well , hopefully i remember something .	i'm sure something will come to mind .	i will remember when i see them .	i hope i have something to talk about .
what a bummer ! you set me up ?	why didn't you tell me ?	how could you deceive me like this ?	i had no idea it was you !	why did you pretend to be someone else ?
let me explain . i didn't mean to hurt you . . .	yes , i set you up .	i really just wanted to see you .	i didn't know what else to do .	i really wanted to talk to you about something .
some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . do you know how jackie chan measures his worth ?	he was a huge star in china .	he was supposed to be the greatest ever .	he starred in almost every action movie in china .	he was a big star in china before he came to america .
he measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . by the way , can you count the breaks ?	yes he is worth many millions	he is among the richest stars	i am not sure of that	no
sure . his skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul - der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . as he said'everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! '	i can't personally count them , but i can look up how many he had . what's your guess on the number of bones he has broken ?	i'm not able too , but he could . do you think he has broken more bones than anyone else in the world ?	you can look up how many he has broken . do you think he even knows how many have been broken after all these years ?	we could look them up . i wonder how he's broken the most bones . do you think it was fighting or doing stunts for movies ?
indeed you know much about him .	true . he considers it as great achievement .	well , it's his life and he is happy about all experience he had .	this is great knowledge about him .	you know really a lot about him .
this is because he is the action - movie incarnate or action - star extraordinaire around the world .	that's because i did a lot of research , and found great detail on his history .	of course ! he was friends with my neighbor , and i've been told many stories .	i learned a lot about him because i'm a member of his fan club !	not really . most of that information is readily available online .
ok .	we can do something else . what do you want to do ?	shall we go to the park instead and play monkey bar ?	yes . shall we ride bike or go for a hike ?	yes . if we go inside , we may get caught .
but they're just ads .	oh , i think you are just a fashion genius .	i suppose you always shop around the fashion shops and know all the latest trends .	okay , how long does it take for your research to finish ?	i see . maybe we go shopping the other day ?
duh . . . that's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what's in . plus , there are articles on new trends .	what do you get out of them ?	is this research for academic reasons ?	may i look at the ads ?	what got you interested in fashion ?
football game ? ok , and you know what comes on next ?	how much longer is the game ?	can i watch the western another time ?	will there be a re run of the game ?	how long will i have to wait ?
i believe there's a sitcom .	yes , ru paul's drag race is on after the game .	it's usually gunsmoke and then bonanaza .	depending on how long the game runs , local and then national news .	after the game is the sports wrap - up .
are you interested in watching it ?	which sitcom is it ? i hope it's something funny .	is it one we've seen before ?	ok , well , maybe there's something on another channel .	well , i want to watch it as soon as the game is over .
let me look in the tv guide first .	if we can watch football now , you can chooe what we watch next .	i haven't really thought that far .	not really , but if you want to we can .	it looks really funny , so i would be intereted .
oh , i am sorry . what's on channel 2 at 10 pm ?	ugh , okay .	i love the tv guide .	okay , go ahead .	that's a good idea because we might find something even better to watch .
if i remember correctly , it's a quiz show .	i think the news .	i don't know . that's why i'm looking at the tv guide .	you already know what comes on then !	am i supposed to know ?
do you want to watch it ?	oh , ok . well let's just watch the western .	hmmm , i don't really like quiz shows .	can we watch something other than a quiz show ?	i don't think i'd enjoy that .
let's watch it together .	no , i think i'll stay home .	i'd really prefer the western .	i don't like quiz shows much .	sure , that'd be great for me .
did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ?	what did you see ?	what was the best sight ?	how was the weather ?	how long did it take to get there ?
sure , we wouldn't miss it for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour .	yes we did but susan fell in the water !	the flood gates were closed so the waterfall was more like my dad doing a # 1 .	no , we passed right by because the gps thought we were in wyoming half the time !	yes but when i checked the camera , every picture was blurry .
you were lucky then . what did you do after that ?	how long did you stay ?	how was the weather while you were there ?	what was the park like ? was it crowded or were you secluded ?	what did you do once you got to the park
we went for a swim in the sea . that was the best part of the day . just look at my nice tan .	well , we had a picnic when we got there .	we hiked the walking trail around the park .	we relaxed and did some people watching .	we planned our next stop while enjoying the sun .
so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday .	yeah , i noticed that and you look great !	i wish i could tan like that .	how did you keep from getting sunburned ?	did you get tan like that for being in the water or did you lay out in the sun ?
yes , you're right . and i was so tired that i fell asleep on the way back . my arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday .	yeah , i did .	it wasn't really busy . it was enjoyable though .	yeah , i hated to come back to work today .	it was nice . we might go back next weekend .
look . here are the core classes . everyone has to take them .	what would you like help with ?	where do you want to start ?	what questions do you have ?	great ! let's do it !
so i don't have to worry about them .	which classes should i take first ?	which classes go best together (	which course is the hardest ?	may i see the course descriptions ?
you're catching on ! however , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics . . .	well , you don't have to worry about them , but you do have to take them .	i'm not sure what you mean .	well yeah , you have to worry about them . you do have to take them .	nope . you have to take them , so you don't have to make any great decisions until you choose your electives .
i'll take home economics .	metal shop seems interesting .	oh nice ! , i didn't know they had wood shop !	can you make me a copy of all the classes ?	home economics seems like it would be fun !
good . now you can pick classes by yourself .	i think you'd be good at that .\	really , i'd guess you'd want metal shop .	let's first look over all the options .	great , i'll take that with you .
that's not the gadgets . creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . it engages their imagination and sharpen their mind .	i agree . texting lingo makes kids not spell well	but there are good parts to technology	kids know much more about things at a much earlier age	they do not rely on gadgets but use them to their advantage
great !	okay , great ! it's at 3 pm on saturday .	awesome ! , i knew i could count on you !	well happy early birthday !	okay so it's gon na be on saturday at 3 pm at my house . i'lll see you there !
when and where ?	where will it be held ?	when will it be held ?	should i bring anything ?	who else will be there ?
five o'clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ?	my house at 7:00pm .	we are going to the pub on clark st . the festivities should begin at 7:00pm .	we are going to the comedy club on chesnut road . the show begins at 8:00pm .	sara is throwing me a dinner party at her place . she says people should come by at around 7:00pm .
yes , i know . i appreciate your invitation .	what is your address ?	who will be there ?	is ellen invited ?	do you need me to bring anything ?
i am going to invite other guys . see you that day .	i am happy you can make it	can't wait	you don't have to bring a present	can you bring some chips
see you .	okay , thanks again . i'm looking forward to it .	happy birthday in advance ! is there anything i can bring ?	okay , i'll see you monday ! thanks again !	i can't wait . . . i'll bring the champagne !
how about your husband . does he help much ?	wow , i'm sorry to hear that .	it does sound like you have a lot of work to do .	you must be really tired .	wow . i'm sorry , that i implied that you have a lot of free time on your hands . it doesn't seem like you do .
not at all . he comes home and complains about his hard day at work . he expects me to do everything . he even wants me to feed him sometimes . can you believe that ?	he helps when he can	he is never around when i need help	his sickness prevents him from helping much	he feels that it is all my job
that sucks .	what ? that is so not right	have you tried talking to him about what all you do ?	i can't believe that	show him everything you do throughout the day
if he wasn't so lazy , i think i wouldn't have any complaints . he mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ?	yes , it really does .	yes , it really does .	i wish he was more helpful .	yeah , i'm just really tired of everything these days .
that's crossing the line .	that's so unreasonable .	what the heck ?	ugh , men .	you need to have a talk with him . what an attitude .
oh well . i'll have to live with it . what else can i do ?	he brought me flowers yesterday .	his back injury has really taken a toll on us .	i hope his back heals soon .	i know , right .
yeah . what's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ?	they try to prepare for the cold weather	what is your favorite sport ?	did you watch the last olympics ?	some contestants are from cold climates so they might not be bothered by the cold
when the olympic games started in modern times , only summer events were included . when it grew popular , there came the winter olympic games , which includes a variety of winter sports .	one happens in the summer and one happens in the winter	they have different rules in place between the two olympics	the winter olympics are more dangerous	summer olympics are generally held in warmer climates
i see . then , what's your favorite winter sport ?	oh , that makes sense .	well it's a good thing they added the winter sports because there's so many of them .	i wonder in what year they added the winter olympics .	i can't imagine it only being summer olympics .
figure skating . in my eye , nothing beats it .	it's a tie between skiing and snowboarding .	i love watching bobsledding .	women's figure skating !	men's hockey .
then you must know shen due and hao hongbo .	what is it about figure skating that captures you ?	i really like to watch the downhill skiers .	my mom use to be a figure skater .	do you ice skate ?
oh , i didn't expect you to know them . but yes , i love them not only because of many medals they've won , but also because of many medals they've won , but also because of their spirits .	i do . they are among the best skaters in the world .	i know them well- and i see you like ice skating , too !	i do know them . they are pretty good .	i know them- i love to watch how graceful they are on the ice .
you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too .	you mentioned , because of how many medals they'eve won twice .	yeah they won a lot of medals , they are very good at what they do .	they do have strong spirits and have the dedication to bring home many medals .	yeah , they are very good at what they do . i enjoy watching them a lot .
that's really a good idea . taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . i recommend you qingdao or dalian .	do you have a favorite beach you'd like to visit ?	would you prefer a seaside location you've been to before , or would you like to plan a seaside adventure in a new place ?	i'd like to go to fiji , with its pristine beaches .	can you give me quotes on a flights from philadelphia or new york ?
i've been to qingdao before , so i'll choose dalian . i've heard that the environment there is very good .	have you been to those places before ?	i can't afford to travel internationally .	qindao sounds wonderful .	i've wanted to go to qingdao for ages .
yes , that's a good place to spend a holiday . last year i went there . it's really .	do you prefer a touristy location or more private ?	what do you like about qingdao ?	did you not prefer qingdao ?	i've never been to dalian , i've heard it's nice though .
thank you !	did you enjoy dalian when you visited ?	where did you eat when you visited dalian ?	what do you recommend i see when i go to dalian ?	would you like to come with me to dalian ?
and english is very useful in your job .	all the business are booming , makes it real easy .	yeah , it definitely could be a good venture .	i believe you will have no problem finding a job in shanghai .	good luck , you got this . you will find a job no problem .
i think it will be very useful in many ways . beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in china , but also in the world , english is useful in almost all walks of life .	yes and i know english very well .	i'm very glad i speak english .	i'm excited for what this new job will bring .	i have worked on my english for many years .
you will be a very promising one .	what type of work will you do there ?	do you plan on starting your own business in shanghai ?	are you going to teach english while you look for work ?	how long do you plan to stay in shanghai ?
that's my wish .	i believe you ar right	i have learned english at a very young age and it has beee very useful	i hope to be very sucessful	i would like to advance my carreer as soon as possible
oh , nice . is he coming on his own or with the family ?	that's very interesting , i would like to meet him some time .	that's sad that you do not get to see him much .	i too wish i got to see my brother more .	when will you see him next ?
his son is coming as well . he wants to go to university here in england so they will visit a few universities while they are here .	he has a pilot license so he's flying into town by himself .	he plans to travel directly to my house and meet the family there .	he's got his own wife and young son so they are traveling alone .	he's traveling with the family .
does your brother have just one son ?	which universitys is he intrested in ?	what will be his major	how many universities will you be visiting ?	which universities will you be visiting ?
no , he has two daughters as well . his wife and daughters are visiting her parents . so i won't see them .	oh , no my brother has three sons . the college age one is his middle son .	yes , he is their only child as well .	my brother has one other son and a daughter .	actually , my brother has twin sons . but only francis is coming to england .
i'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson .	i see . are you going to visit the universities with them ?	how old is your brothers son ?	do you plan on visiting him in new zealand in the future ?	are they staying for very long ?
oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . they went to new zealand last year and loved it .	yea they won't stop talking about it .	maybe they will , we will see .	i think they are actually not looking forward to it for some reason .	they are sick and not feeling well .
so when are they all coming ?	i've always wanted to visit new zealand . i've heard it is beautiful !	i've heard it is super hot down in new zealand . is that true ?	i'm glad they are going to get to see them !	i hope they have a wonderful trip !
my parents are already here . my brother and nephew are arriving on monday .	in two weeks , but only for a few days .	they're flight lands tomorrow , then i'll have to pick them all up .	two days from now , i'm so excited to see them again .	they should be arriving in a few hours , actually .

did you get a job right after graduation ?	i've always wanted to visit texas !	what did you study in college ?	how did you like texas ?	why did you choose to go to college in texas ?
no , i traveled for a while in europe after college , and then i lived in france .	no actually , the job market sucks .	yes , but it wasn't the same field as my degree though .	yes , i took an internship at an office nearby after i graduated .	no , it was really difficult to find a job even after i graduated college .
when was that ?	do you ever think about settling down ?	do you prefer moving around rather than planting your roots in one place ?	did you backpack while you were there ?	was that your first time outside the country ?
let's see . . . that was about six years ago .	a few years ago .	right before i moved back here .	for just a couple years , and then i moved back here .	just a few years ago . have you always lived here ?
i bet that was interesting . what did you do there ?	sounds like you love to travel , that's great .	what did you do while you were in france ?	when did you leave france then ?	did you moved back here after leaving france ?
i studied french . anyway . . . that's enough about me . how about you ? were you born in l . a . ?	when i was in france ? or when i travelled europe ?	i lived in paris , so i saw all the sites .	mainly the countryside . that's where i lived . i got to paris a few times though .	not as much as i would've liked . i was busy working there .
does your husband feel the same ?	i think you have the right attitude about kindly to yourself .	when you say keeping housework simple , does that mean you have a cleaning service ?	does your husband agree with spending money on things for yourself or do you just kind of sneak those purchases through ?	we moms should stick together and be nice to ourselves and each other and then maybe go out shopping .
yes . he is very understanding and supportive .	i believe that he does , since he's very caring and respectful .	absolutely he does , otherwise i would nt be married to him	he sure does , and is very supportive of my roles as a mother and career woman .	yes , and he is also very supportive .
i'm worried that what i say will not make sense .	wow , thank you for the insight .	i will try to be a little more expressive in class , thank you for the encouragement .	well that is quite encouraging and i think i'll be able to next time .	i really like the positive outlook you have and i hope to employ it myself in class .
we could chat about the topic before class . i could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking .	maybe that will help you to form clearer ideas .	you shouldn't worry about not making sense .	you should say things that make sense then !	don't say something that doesn't make sense and you will be just fine .
that's a good idea . what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic ?	i appreciate the thought , but i think i'll be ok .	that sounds great ! where should we meet ?	thank you for letting me vent , but i feel better now .	i'm sure i'll be logical , i'm just being illogical !
that's easy . express possibilities . people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle .	just pick one and hope for the best .	pick your favorite opinion and talk about it .	weigh both opinions against each other by yourself .	talk about both if you want .
i didn't realize that speaking in class could be so easy .	thanks for calming my nerves and answering all of my questions	you're really helping me keep calm . i feel less nervous already .	can you help me narrow the topic down when i get more specific ?	can we meet on the weekend to go over the possibilites ?
the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . they will reply to your statements , but you can't be sure how .	it is and it gets easier the more you do it . you'll see !	it's hard at first but after you get that one attempt out , it become far more easy .	yes , and i'll be there , too . i'll be sure to start the conversation or ask you a question to get the ball rolling .	you'll be surprised how easy it is after awhile . you'll wonder why you thought it was hard !
tom and bill smith . they are both working now you know ? and they've bought a new house .	lisa's party . she told me she was going to send you one .	my party , remember ? i told you i was having one . i sent it , i wonder what happened .	my mother's . she just moved into a new place and we thought it would be fun to have a housewarming to cheer her up .	it's bill and dana's housewarming . they just bought a new house . i'm sure they sent you one . i'll find out .
oh , they have ? i didn't know . i haven't seen tom lately .	sounds fun , i hope i get one in the mail soon .	what if they didn't invite me to the party ?	i bet i will get the invitation soon , my mail is so slow .	no , but i haven't checked my mail today yet . i'll look for it .
it's out in the suburbs .	makes sense . he's been busy at work .	i haven't either . so i'm happy to see him at this party .	i saw him last week . he's really happy now that they have jobs and a house .	i saw him yesterday . he mentioned that he hadn't seen you in a while either .
have you seen the house ?	that's really cool for him .	maybe i'll give him a call this week .	i wonder why he hasn't contacted me about it .	oh wow , big life changes !
yes , i have . i went out with them last weekend .	i have seen the house , it is nice .	i have not seen the house yet .	they showed me pictures , but i have not been there yet .	i have seen the house , you will like it .
is it nice ?	i would like to visit them this weekend	do you have the address of their new house	i think i misplaced the invitation	i will call them and congratulate them
yes , it is . there are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen .	it's so nice . you have to come see it !	it's pretty good , but way out there .	i like it , but i wouldn't want that commute .	i'm the most jealous person on earth right now !
there's also a garden .	that's nice .	i'm happy for them .	when is the party ?	it sounds like you're closer to them than i am .
well , that does sound nice . have they moved in yet ?	yes a lovely big garden .	they're going to put in a big vegetable garden .	yes a beautiful flower garden .	oh yes , they have award winning flowers .
they are moving today . tom's taken the day off . he's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight .	i don't think so .	i think they move in next weekend .	they asked my son to help move furniture tomorrow , so maybe tomorrow ?	yes , they moved in last month .
when are they going to have the party ?	that's great for them !	i'm so jealous the house is so nice	maybe i can help them move in	i can't wait for the party !
next saturday night . you should get your invitation today or tomorrow .	it's saturday afternoon-- a casual thing-- a cookout and cocktails .	it's next weekend . i hope the weather hold because it's a patio party .	next friday evening . it's just a small casual party . hopefully you will get your invite .	it's next week , a few close friends and coworkers is all they invited from what i've heard .
wow , that would be something to look forward to .	i hope they invited me .	i should start thinking about a gift they would like then .	i can't wait to see their house !	i'll bet the dinner will be amazing !
wonderful ! i think that's a great idea . how soon until we can make this happen ? i can't wait !	do you have a place in mind ?	what about a trip to a local city instead ?	that would help me get away for a bit .	that would actually be nice . things are just so busy right now and quiet would help .
tomorrow i have an appointment with my dentist . what about next monday ?	i can take time off whenever i want to .	i need to give a one week notice before vacation .	i have that big project this month , so it'll have to be next month .	as soon as possible . i'm excited !
perfect . i'll start preparing tomorrow . if we're going to drive , i'll need to fill up the tank .	i will have to check with work to see if i can take off that quickly .	monday works great for me , i am so excited .	i need to give work a bit more notice , how about the following monday ?	what about tuesday instead ?
no need . i think it's still plenty full . even so , i'd rather travel by bus or train . it would cost much less than driving . oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know .	we are driving and i will take care of the gas	i think we will fly and then hire a cab	i can not wait to go on this trip .	i will take lots of pictures and post on facebook and instagram
we can take the train , that will be faster . i'll book the tickets tomorrow morning .	don't get me started on oil !	oh okay . i'll follow your lead .	my car is fine . we're taking it .	oil has no business in our conversations .
great ! oh , one more thing , don't forget to check the weather before we go . i'd hate to get caught in the rain .	we should look for the best deals before deciding to purchase tickets .	we need to also decidr on where to stay and what we will do while there .	i think the train will be relaxing for both of us - no worries or stress about driving .	i think this trip will be what we both need .
no problem . i'm really looking forward to the coming week .	me too , i dislike being in the rain .	i will bring an umbrella just in case .	i will be sure to check the weather this evening .	i already did and weather is suppose to be lovely .
me , too . now let's make a list for what we need to take with us .	it will be nice to get away .	thanks for booking the tickets , let me know what i owe you .	could you make reservations at that cafe we like for dinner ? i won't have time to do it and you know how busy they get .	if it looks like rain lets pick a different weekend .
yeah , i broke up with lisa . she blew a gasket over it . whoa , get a load of that !	nope . not like that .	more like a hookup .	definitely not a girlfriend , just a hookup .	you know me .
whew ! that getup is terrific !	what happened between you two ?	wow ! go for it !	why did you dump her ?	wait , i thought you guys were getting along ?
never mind the getup . she's beautiful !	she looks really good .	i am going to go buy her a drink .	i am going to go talk to her .	she would never go for me .
that too .	she is all beauty but no brains	iam glad iam out of this	i can not wait till i get a new one	is any of your friends single and ready to mingle
i'm gon na introduce myself .	do you think i have a chance ?	what should i say ?	could you talk to her first ?	you coming with me ?
if you're lucky , that might do the trick .	don't blow it .	lisa never looked that good .	good luck with that .	tell her she must have a mirror around her waist because you see yourself in her pants .
oh , oh , that tears it ! i'm getting out of here .	i'm always lucky .	i hope so , really want to meet her .	yeah maybe break the ice at least .	cross your fingers for me .
hold on ! what's the big hurry ?	she is hot , have fun , text me tomorrow with details .	does she have a friend for me ?	i'll go with you man .	sorry she rejected you .
my ex - girlfriend's here . if she sees me , my goose is cooked .	she told me she wasn't interested ! that's embarassing .	she was with her boyfriend !	she completely ignored me and made me look like a fool .	she's my cousin ! i can't flirt with her !
i wanna finish my drink first . i'll meet you at sammy's .	oh no ! do you want to go to a different bar ? >	haha ! you should just calm down . i'm sure it's fine and you can stay and hang out with me .	lol ! well , she is your " ex " after all , so you should just stay and avoid her .	really ? you're going to run out of here because she's here ? you can't avoid her forever .
ok , catch you later .	ok , i'm outta here .	ah , never mind . we're not an item , so what i do is none of her business .	on second thought , i'm staying . she's not the boss of me .	ok , see you there .
what about abraham lincoln ? did you get any questions about him ?	oh thanks ! i'll keep those in mind .	who was he again ?	the civil war is my favorite one .	oh good . i'll be fine then .
i only had 1 question about him . but you might get more . i do nt know if he will have the same exam or not .	there were several , as the test seemed to focus on the civil war .	there was a lot about lincoln's stance on slavery .	there were a few ; though not as man as i would have thought , given the emphasis placed on the civil war .	there were a few ; though not as man as i would have thought , given the emphasis placed on the civil war .
hopefully he will use the same exam , cause i m going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .	i bet it will be a different one .	probably not , i think she will change it .	the exam is probably changed everyday .	oh i doubt that , too easy to cheat .
if you ca nt study everything , then that is probably the best way to go .	i bet he will ask you a lot about the civil war .	study the civil war in detail . there were so many questions on it .	good luck on the exam . it was painful . i am glad it is over .	want to go out and celebrate when your exam is over ?
aright . thanks for the info . i got ta go to the library now .	i agree , i'll focus on that completely	maybe he will change it up so i'll study a range of things .	do you think you could share some of the questions that you remember ?	maybe ill just try to cheat like last test
good luck .	ok . let me know if you need help studying later . good luck !	ok , good luck on the test . i'm sure you will do fine , so don't worry too much !	ok , they close at 5 today , so make sure you get enough time to study !	ok , i'll talk to you later . if you want help studying just text me .
thanks . see ya .	thanks ! i'll let you know how it comes out .	thanks ! this is so frustrating .	thanks ! i might also skim over the other chapter summaries and whatever lecture notes i have time for .	i appreciate your help . fingers crossed !
is classical music your favorite ?	which songs or pieces do you like best from mozart ?	yeah i like mozart as well , but the benefits it offers sound good .	what's your favorite song from mozart ?	what are types of artists do you like listening to ?
yes . what about you ?	i really like classical music , it's not my favorite though .	yes , mozart is my all time favorite composer as well .	i really enjoy classical music , it's definitely one of my favorites .	it is a great genre of music , but i'm more of a rock music guy .
i like pop music best . classical music is a bit too heavy for me . i can't get fully relaxed in it .	i also love classical music . my favorite composer is bach .	i like classical music and world music about the same .	yes ! it's rare to find another classical music fan .	same ! i play violin and cello .
pop music doesn't have any depth for me .	there are some remixes that make classical music have a bit of a pop beat . you might like them .	i understand . classical music is not for everyone .	when i was younger i did not like it , but found the more i listened to it , the more it grew on me .	i used to hate classical music until i had a classical music cd stuck in my car . after listening to mozart for a while , i couldn't get enough .
yeah , that's why i can enjoy myself in it .	i'm just not into classical .	classical is too old fashioned for me to listen to much .	i'd rather listen to something more recent .	music doesn't need to have depth to be worth listening to .
did you always like pop music .	that's cool . i usually find most pop music is repetitive .	i see . pop music is very bland and boring in comparison to compositions by classical musicians .	to each their own .	nice . pop music is my least favorite genre .
i think so , since i was in primary school . how long have you been interested in classical music .	i have , i heard it as a kid and have always enjoyed listening to it .	i have nt , i actually just really started listening to it the past few years .	i did nt , for a long time i used to make fun of it but as i got older i started to enjoy it more .	i did , my mom used to listen to it all the time so i am very used to hearing it/
i didn't like it at all until i started to learn violin when i was eight . from then on . classical music has been an important part of my life .	i've always loved classical music .	ever since my parents played it for me as a child .	classical music was always playing in my home .	ever since i saw an orchestra at the concert hall i've loved classical music .
oh , i didn't know you can play the violin . do you still play .	do you still play the violin ?	do you play any other instruments as well ?	did you ever play with others ?	that's so interesting . i wish i had learned to play an instrument .
sometimes , but these days i'm often too busy .	sometimes , but i'm rusty . i was better when i was younger .	i try to keep it up so that the lessons weren't all wasted .	i play it just about every day . it soothes me and reminds me of childhood .	i do it whenever i think about my mom . she paid a lot for those lessons and she would've wanted me to continue .
sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away .	what you think about during the day leaks into your dreams .	my dreams are so disjointed , they are just a jumble of images .	he was just so focused on his object !	yeah , exotic vacation dreams are the best !
that's crazy .	that's interesting . he must have been real invested in his sport .	that sounds inappropriate . please don't tell me anymore details .	wow , i've experienced that before from a dream too . except my dream was exciting .	he sounds like a real intense athlete .
yes , i am . i am from guangzhou . i am here to study international relations .	i am not . i started learning in elementary school .	my parents are chinese born , but i am a first - generation american .	not by birth , but i have a spiritual connection to the culture .	yes , which is why it's easier for me . that's why you should feel proud !
how do you like it ?	do you think it's easier for a native chinese person to learn english ?	we could help each other with our language , if you'd like .	isn't it expensive to study abroad ?	guangzhou , where half the world's consumer products are made !
i like it so far . but my english still needs work .	i love it .	i like learning about diplomatic relations between countries .	i find it easy because of a lot of resources .	i am happy with it as i get to interact with students from different countries .
i want to study mandarin and public relations .	do you enjoy the culture ?	is there a lot of differences ?	do you want to stay in the us ?	i think your english is great .
you are right . but what if an avalanche happened ?	you're right . my first instinct is just to worry .	why ? you don't agree that it's dangerous ?	fine , fine , fine ! i was just saying . . .	you're right . my mom was always too strict anyway .
they are all great skiers and very experienced . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim .	then a lot of people could die .	i've seen video where a skier out ran an avalanche !	i'm pretty sure they check the snow first .	naw , they drop explosives first to dislodge unstable snow .
anyway , the show is breathtaking . by the way , where did they get so much snow here ?	hope so . but you never know .	good to know . the show will be exciting then .	oh , i see . how about someone getting injured seriously ?	okay then , let's enjoy the show .
well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine .	they trucked it in .	it snowed for the last week .	we are on a mountain , so there is snow .	i think they made it themselves .
do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ?	you sure the snow - making machine is safe ?	this still looks like it could be really dangerous .	all that snow is really fake ? its not real snow ?	oh wow that is amazing , to think they could use a snowmaking machine to get all the snow here .
it's possible .	you are such a worrywort !	does it really matter ?	i suppose you can google that answer	i suppose you can google that answer
some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team !	nancy , in accounting told me that the seats could be most likely court side seats .	the gal in accounting knew the seats where going for a good price .	nancy in accounting . however , it's the off season , so these seats aren't as expensive as you'd think .	nancy in accounting . she is also an avid nba fan .
can't beat that ! thank you accounting guy !	that brother must be at a higher level on the team .	okay , we'll gon na have a blast tonight .	thank god ! finally , we gon na be on the courtside .	as always , accountants have something up their sleeves !
the game starts at seven so we'd better hustle , it's already five .	i am so excited for the game .	i have never sat so close .	have you ever sat so close ?	it is going to be the best game ever .
what are we waiting for ? let's go !	nice , ill head on over and we can head out from your place .	sweet , are you gon na be coming to pick me up . ?	yeah its almost game time , lets roll out .	alright sounds good man . just let me know what the game plan is . i m ready .
actually , i watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci - fi or a suspense movie . how about you ?	i like documentaries best .	mostly horror and drama movies . but i will watch a good movie if it had a great review .	i like old style movies from the 1970s and 1960s best	movies that aren't too long . any type of moive
art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too .	i like sci - fi too . what's your favorite ?	i can't take suspense movies . too much anxiety for me .	oh , me too . did you see the new will ferrell movie ? it's hilarious .	i just watch whatever's on netflix .
really impressive . these two genres are totally different .	oh , i like thrillers too !	i like horror movies also , do you like horror movies ?	what's your favorite thriller movie ?	do you have a favorite movie director ?
sure . i enjoy both of them very much .	i like a lot of variety in my movies .	you would be surprised how much overlap there is between art films and thrillers .	it is certainly an odd mix of movies genres .	i think art films and thrillers are generally well - made which is why i like them .
how often do you go to the cinema ?	i like them aswell .	my favorite between those is thrillers !	i also like artsy films .	what is your favorite thriller ?
once in a while , i suppose , i usually rent movies at movie salon .	i try to go at least a few times a month .	once a week is ideal .	not very often , i prefer to watch movies at home .	whenever there is something worth seeing .
movie salon ? where is that ?	i like the big screen , so i usually go to the cinema .	i've heard of movie salon . do they have a good selection ?	you miss out on the good movie theater popcorn when you rent movies .	it is more affordable to rent movies , than to go to the cinema .
it's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . i've got a membership there .	you have to google it .	its inside the mall ?	you re never heard of a movie salon ?	i m just kidding , i use netflix .
is it good ?	i have never heard of a movie salon	that sounds interesting	that is so old school	do they have a good selection
yes , you can find almost all new releases there .	it's okay , it's just close to my house so i got there .	yes , they have a ton of movies there to choose from .	i'ts just like any other rental place , but my best friend works there .	yes , i like it . i used to work there in high school so i still like going there .
really ? maybe i shall also sign up for its membership .	they must have a large genre to choose from .	i might have to check it out .	how much was the membership ?	i wish there was one closer to where i live .
why not ?	yes it is really convienient	we can go together then to pick out movies	you will love it they have a wide selection	go for it . you wo nt regeret it
three months .	i am two months pregnant now . can you believe that ?	i'll be going into my second trimester next week . exciting times !	i just found out yesterday !	i took a pregnancy test last week , so i'm guessing it's been less than a month .
are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ?	have you had ultrasounds yet ?	how are you feeling about impending parenthood ?	just call me if you need a babysitter , alright ?	wow , only half a year before we get the meet the baby !
i want to , but bob doesn't . he wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way .	no . we want it to be a surprise .	yes . we already know what it is going to be !	my husband and i aren't sure yet about that decision .	i really want to find out , but my husband doesn't want to know .
maybe it's more exciting not knowing .	you could find out and then he could wait .	are you going to wait then ?	are you going to find out anyway ?	what gender would you prefer ?
i'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time .	not for me it is nt .	maybe you re right .	its stressing me out not knowing .	i wish i could find out .
there are so many things you have to prepare for .	you could find out and not tell bob . but you might not be able to keep it a secret for that long .	tell him you don't like surprises .	you could buy gender neutral things or even a few boy things and a few girl things . keep the tags on until after the baby is born . that way you can return what you don't use .	i think i agree with bob on this issue .
i know i am going to be busy , but i know i can handle it . i have been looking forward to this day for a long long time .	yes , we need to get the nursery ready .	absolutely . we still have some time though .	my sister is helping a lot .	it's overwhelming .
it really must be an exciting time for you guys .	if you need anything just let me know	well congrats again	but it's worth it	you both will be great parents
thank you so much .	it is , i can not wait until it's time for the baby to be here .	yes , i'd love for you to come to my baby shower .	it is , do you have any children ?	thanks , it's the best time of my life right now .
what a pity ! you can't join us .	what are you doing ?	you should skip your plans and join me .	what time will you be busy tomorrow ?	you could come to the event late .
so sorry . next time we'll go , thanks anyway .	i know , i m sorry .	maybe next time .	lets try for next week .	i'll let you know if anything changes .
ok . i'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm .	so you like sushi ?	i hate sea food .	sea food is the bomb .	do you like octopus ?
that's fine . i'll be waiting for you .	okay , i'll be out front waiting for you . what kind of car do you drive ?	can you make it 6:45 . i don't think i can be ready by 6:30 .	sounds great . what restaurant are we going to ?	i appreciate you spending time with me . i'll pay for the meal .
see you later .	great . see you then !	then it's a plan .	i'll be looking forward to it .	super .
bye .	do you need me to bring anything	thanks for the offer	i will be waiting	see you then
you seem to have a very relaxed outlook .	yes , i agree , that's why i go out on the weekend to relax .	what kinds of fun things do you like to do to unwind ?	we should have out one night after work .	let me know when you have some free time so we can get together .
it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress .	i do what i have to .	thanks , i have learned to no let things stress me anymore .	i might seem to have a relaxed outlook now , but in the past i was a total mess .	it all comes down to how you handle the situation , i try to let it roll off my back .
but i don't think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses .	how many hours do you work per week ?	are you required to check email on weekends and at night ?	what is your profession ?	have you always been this way ?
i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .	even though we are not our own bosses , we are the masters of our own destiny . we control the outcome of our lives and futures with our mental attitude .	anything the mind can conceive and believe , it can achieve , so in a roundabout way , we are indeed our own bosses .	you can always change your stress level by altering the way you think , regardless of being a boss or not a boss , or what your working conditions are .	the boss does not decide your mental attitude and stress level , you do yourself .
i'm not sure . i don't enjoy cooking that much . as long as we can order it from a restaurant , we don't have to learn to do it by ourselves .	sounds interesting . let me know the details .	absolutely ! let's cook it up	as long as they teach how to make it hot and spicy , sure !	i'm always open to new experiences , so lets go to chinatown
you are right . but i just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different .	yeah , but it's more fun to learn how to do it though .	i think you would probably like it if you gave it a chance .	well , cooking can be relaxing , once you have the basics down .	i think you would like it a bit more than going to a restaurant all the time , plus it saves you a ton of money .
what can you do when this happens ?	what do they say when you tell them they are not sick ?	how do you handle a situation like that ?	i can only imagine . that would drive me nuts .	do you have patients who keep coming back insisting no matter what you tell them ? i couldn't deal with that .
not much , usually i'll just keep silent .	i try to explain what symptoms i look for .	i explain that prescription companies often try to convince people they are sick in order to sell them medication .	i tell them i can recommend another doctor if they want a second opinion .	usually not much . they just end up leaving upset with me .
but the reservation keeps the car here . that's why you have the reservation .	don't reservations reserve a vehicle for the reserver ?	so what was the point of a reservation ?	i want to talk to the manager now .	do you have any cars available ?
i know why we have reservations .	i understand your frustration .	we can upgrade you to a larger car at the same price .	i am sorry , sir . let me tell you what we do have available .	would you like to speak to my manager ?
i don't think you do . if you did , i'd have a car . see , you know how to take the reservation , you just don't know how to hold the reservation and that's really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . anybody can just take them .	this is unacceptable . is the manager around , i'd like to talk to him / her .	i am very angry about this . i made a reservation and it is not taken seriously ?	exactly , what do you suggest i do now ?	i will try to make arrangements with another company . i have been a customer for over 10 years and you've just lost my business .
but we do have a compact or an suv if you'd like .	sir , quoting seinfeld will not help you here .	do you need to speak with my manager ?	let me go see my manager . perhaps they can explain better than i can .	let me check the back one more time . i am so sorry about all of this !
fine . i'll take the compact .	i will never use your company again .	i want a midsize !	i'll take an suv , but i want a discount	i want my money back !
alright . we have a blue ford focus for you , mr . fox . would you like insurance ?	i'm sorry for the inconvenience this caused you .	great . i am going to get the paperwork now .	i understand your frustration . we are going to give you a ten percent discount for the inconvenience .	great . let's go ahead and bump you up to an suv at no additional cost .
yeah , you better give me the insurance , because i am gon na beat the hell out of this car .	yes i will take the insurance .	no i will be careful .	no i don't like the price of your insurance .	i can't afford your insurance .
what ? what kind of drugs was he using ?	what drug did he get busted for ?	that is a real shame .	he should get some help .	that is unfortunate . so much talent wasted .
he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster .	he was using something to improve his abilities .	i don't know , but clearly he was doing something illegal .	i think he was caught with cocaine in his system .	he was using some kind of performing enhancing drug .
i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .	oh that is too bad .	is that why he was so good ?	do you think the steroids made him that good ?	when did they find out about his drug usage ?
they are . the only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .	not all of them .	i don't think so , but they should be .	i thought so also .	i don't know , but they should be .
that's so disappointing . i don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .	they should be able to get test results immediately .	he had to know that he would test positive on the drug test .	it's a shame to see him disqualified .	i bet he regrets taking the drugs now that he is disqualified .
i don't think it's right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !	i don't understand either .	he must be se desparated .	he probably wants to win without thinking through .	he might take it by accident .
regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs .	you're right , especially with everyone watching .	it must be very hard with all that scrutiny but that's a big risk .	after all that hard work to get there , it's a shame to throw it away in such a shameful way .	is that pressure worth the disqualification , especially when they know they'll be tested ?
i agree . hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs .	unless you can get away with it !	i agree , its probably not the smartest way to try to win .	especially if you end up getting caught and losing the medal anyway .	if there is even a small chance of getting caught , it probably doesn't make sense .
let's hope so .	how disappointing ! i was rooting for him !	don't these athletes realize how dangerous steroids are ?	i wonder if he will be able to compete in the next olympics ? or do they disqualify them for life if they are caught using steroids ?	how sad . he was such a role model for the youth of today .
in taiwan , prime - time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies .	well , maybe i should start watching them then .	hmm . that sounds like it might be interesting .	i might have to start watching them then . that sounds interesting .	i like me some mystery shows though .
i think americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time .	that's too bad for you !	you should watch some american shows online !	have you ever seen any american ones ?	what is your favorite type of show ?
then what about the salary ? would you get more ?	well does it pay better than the job you are doing now ?	maybe you should come up with a list of pros and cons for each	do you have a sense of how the people will be at the job ?	what kind of work would you be doing if you accept the offer ?
yes , they say i would get a big sum .	yes it pays a little more but the work environment isn't as good . i need to make a list of pros and cons .	no it doesn't pay more . but the expectations and deadlines are more flexible with my new offer .	it pays 10 ,000 more a year , but i hate to leave my friends behind . i'm not sure it's worth it .	no it doesn't pay more but it takes my career in a different direction . it opens up many more opportunities for advancement .
have you discussed it with your wife ?	do you know what the work environment is like at the new job ?	it might be better to stay where you are currently happy with your colleagues .	maybe you could meet with some current employees and see what they have to say about working there .	more money doesn't equal more happiness so you're right to think this through .
yes , she leaves it to me .	yes . she would like me to take it so we can save up for a house more easily .	i have . she is very supportive and wants me to do what will make me happy .	yes . she is concerned about the longer commute each day and the increased amount of travel .	not yet . i just found out a few hours ago .
as i say it the work is well worth try . after all you can get a higher salary .	so what do you think ?	will you take it ?	you should take it .	i think you should take it .
i have to think about it .	i'm not sure the higher salary is enough reason to change jobs when i am happy with the work i do now	what if i decide to take the job and then find out it's not for me ?	if i take the job , there is no going back . i just can't decide if i it would be a good decision .	i suppose you're right , i could use more money .
what do you think our chance are in other events .	what ? you don't think we can win ?	i'm not so sure , i think those gold medals are ours . especially after seeing how fast her is .	you're right , gold medals are hard to win . we're competing against so many others .	wishful thinking can't hurt . it'd be nice to win a gold !
in the last olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . i think we'll do well in those same events .	i think we usually do good at all of the events so i see us getting a lot of medals .	i think we are going to sweep the medals at a lot of events this time .	i think we have a good chance in pretty much all of the events .	i see us getting a medal in nearly all of the events .
we might get a gold medal in the sailing too . our team put in a lot of practice .	i really enjoy watching swimming , it is one of my favorite events !	where are the olympics being held this time ?	we should have an olympic themed party to kick off the event .	what events are your favorite ?
i think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total .	i think you will too .	well , good luck !	you can do it !	i believe in you !
you are very optimistic !	there is reason to be hopeful ! our teams have put in the work .	that's a number to be proud of . we've earned it .	you're an optimist like me ! we're here to cheer them on toward these goals .	you're on the money ! i bet we do at least that well .
you're a very good player	sounds good , we should hop on it .	alright , maybe we could sit there and play then .	sounds good let's grab the chessboard before someone else does .	alright , that means it's up for grabs . shall we ?
not really , but once i won a prize .	i'll take it easy on you at first .	i'll give you some pointers along the way .	nah , i'm just average .	i'm decent at the strategy part , but i made a lot of mistakes .
so did i . i won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners .	what kind of prize ?	were you proud ?	who else was there ?	that's great !
my prize was for the best player in the country . now let's start playing chess seriously .	k , well let's see what you got .	mine was for a beginner's tournament , too .	i'm a little rusty , so you probably have an advantage .	hey , you have to start somewhere .
got it .	what happened in that scene ?	what was so funny about it ?	was that scene meant to be funny ?	is that scene typical of the book ? like are there other scenes that are funny like that one ?
have you ever read this book before ?	i mean , it has some jokes in it , but it's not a comedy .	it's a pretty good mix between light and dark .	some of the characters are pretty funny though .	the movies are more comedic than the books .
no , but my little brother likes it very much .	no i haven't .	i have not yet .	maybe i will soon .	can't say i have .
it's really a good book . you will like it too .	your little brother has good taste .	you should really check them out .	once you start , you won't want to put them down .	well if you start reading them , make sure you begin with the first book and read them in order .
i'll try to read it . actually , i like literature very much .	could i borrow it from you ?	are there any other books you can recommend ?	that one seems kind of long . is it a pretty easy read ?	thanks , i think i will read it .
wow , that sounds like a scholar . by the way , who's your favorite writer ?	that's a good thing .	i'm glad you will !	tell me how much you like it afterward .	that's good , very good .
jane austen .	i don't have a favorite .	oh my , let me think .	my all time favorite is steven spielberg .	stephen king by far is .
me too . pride and prejudice is my favorite .	i have nt read much of her work , i ve heard she is a good author though .	i read her work all the time ! what is your favorite title ?	i prefer more fantasy based reading , but i have heard good things .	i do nt like her work , i m just not a fan of her writing style .
i like it too . but sense and sensibility is my favorite .	some people think it's too hard of a book to read . i don't agree .	i love the written word .	reading is my favorite thing to do .	when did you read it ?
what kind of power struggles are you talking about ?	what kind of struggles ?	tell me more ?	why don't you like it ?	i would like it .
basically , i think tim is threatened by me . i'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career !	working with that man !	he always makes me look bad in front of everyone in our meetings .	he had the nerve to take credit for a job i did !	ugh , i don't even want to talk about it right now . it will just upset me more .
so he talks about you behind your back ?	let's talk about it and see what we can figure out .	has he said anything to you ?	don't do anything rash .	you worked too hard to just quit .
yes . he's all nice and friendly to my face . but the second i turn around he stabs me in the back !	i'm sure he does .	i think he does .	pretty sure he does .	he might be .
i had a worker like that once . she was always taking credit for my ideas .	oh my goodness , that's so not ok .	maybe you should talk to him .	perhaps you should ask him why he does it ?	well just ignore him , everyone knows the kind of person of you are .
i should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary i can prove it was my effort .	that s terrible , how did you deal with her ?	were you able to put an end to it ?	what did you do to make her stop ?	tim is like that , its horrible !
my co - worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . she liked to name - drop . . . we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday i was chatting with tom . she meant tom solomon . . . our ceo .	that would be a really good idea .	i think that's a great idea . then you could take it to the bosses and show them with proof .	it's sad when other people have to be like that .	it's too bad when people try to sabotage someone else instead of just working harder .
i don't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring . he just kept staring at me . he didn't stop .	see that man across the street ?	look down the road , see the fella with the green jacket .	i don't know who i just keep hearing footsteps behind me .	that lady across the street int he cab .
what did you do ?	how did you respond to him ?	did you notice him again after that ?	what happened after you left the cafe ?	did you say anything to him or the waitress ?
i didn't do anything . finally , he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd's . but then he came in too .	i called my husband and he talked to me until i got to my car safely .	i found a security guard to walk me out to my car .	i notified a security guard and he walked me out to my car .	i called the police and gave a description of the man .
did he leave when you left ?	i think you need to notify the police .	how scary . have you told the authorities ?	be careful . i think you need to report him .	have you told your family ? please be careful . there are too many weirdos out in the world .
yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me .	you should talk to him .	you should approach him .	you are ask him directly .	you should ask him why .
what did you do ?	is he cute ? maybe he just likes you .	i wonder if it's just someone who works in that area and thinks you're cute .	are you going to go back there ? maybe it's time you started shopping elsewhere .	how far did he follow you ?
is it close by ?	where at ? is it convenient to get to ?	surprise me , lets go !	is it mexican food ? i m craving some mexican right now .	do you ? where do you think i should go ?
it's down a block on the right ; can i show you the way ?	yeah , it's just five minutes away from here .	yeah , it's just a couple of streets over .	it's about fifteen minutes away , but worth it .	yeah , it's really close by .
ok , i'd love the company .	yes . show me the shortest route .	please do . i'll head that direction .	no thanks . i think i figured it out .	let's go before i starve .
this will work out well . i'm getting hungry just thinking about it .	that's great !	ok , let's go then !	what are we waiting for then !	you'll love the food !
you went out and bought khakis , too !	i just got those !	those are the pants i bought the last time we went to the mall .	they don't look familiar ? check my closet .	c'mon are you kidding ? i wear them every week !
no . mine are a soft brown . yours are khaki .	i'm not a copycat	i did nt know they were the same	i love those khakis so i had to have them	hey yo they are just my style
whatever .	no , mine are the same color .	i guess the color is a little different .	they're awfully similar .	they're close enough . we'll need to coordinate so we don't wear them at the same time .
no , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .	nope , he really did .	i'm surprised to . i guess they see something in him that we don't .	he spends a lot of time complimenting the boss , so i think that's why he got promoted .	management seems to like him so i wasn't that surprised .
i don't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years .	but he never does anything right !	how could he have possibly gotten it over you ?	wow , i didn't see that one coming .	but he's the worst salesperson on the team .
well , it's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul .	yes but he has tons of experience .	he's really got a knack for this though .	he has better handle on the developements in e - commerce than many of us though	after his sky rocketing sales last month how could they not promote him ?
well . good for him .	that's crazy !	i still don't believe you !	you're wrong !	that's insane !
that's too bad .	is there another store nearby ?	oh man , i was supposed to get butter for dinner .	i keep forgetting they aren't 24 hours .	in that case , do you happen to have some salt i can borrow ?
don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . it opens at 8 : 00 .	not to worry . i'll go tomorrow .	i know . need anything that i might have in my cabinet ? you are welcome to come look .	want to go find some appetizers in stead ?	good news is that they open at 4 tomorrow morning .
alright . what do you want to do now ?	that's fine i guess .	well no choice here !	ok , that's fine .	then that's what we'll do .
let's take a walk for a half an hour . my sister will get here at about 8 : 30pm and then we can all go out to dinner .	let's watch a movie together .	how about we fix that broken door ?	let's make a big dinner to enjoy .	we can catch up on our favorite show .
where does she live ?	ok , let me get my sneakers .	that sounds good . i haven't gotten enough exercise lately .	yeah , let's do it . it's a great day for walking .	that's a good way to work up an appetite .
she lives in san francisco .	i'm not sure , she just moved last week .	about an hour from here .	she lives in houston now .	you know where she lives , the same place we visited last year , remember ?
how long has she lived there ?	oh cool ! we'll have something to talk about .	wow , that's a long drive for her .	is she staying over ? i hope she's not planning to drive back to san francisco tonight .	oh that's not too far . a walk sounds perfect .
i think she's lived there for about 10 years .	for a while now .	for some time .	for a little time .	not too long .
that's a long time . where did she live before that ?	how many times has she visited over the last 10 years .	how many times have seen her over the last few years .	wow 10 years is a long time .	does she plan to live year the rest of her life .
san diego .	before that she lived in ventura . it's kind of a small not so great of area .	bro , you're asking too many questions about my sister . why do you care so much ?	she lived in sacramento for a bit . i'm not sure how long honestly .	she lived in oregon with her ex - husband . she hated it there apparently .
i read that story too . they seem to be able to understand men .	that's just amazing .	reall , is it true , are you sure ?	i heard about that too .	i've heard wonderful stories about dolphins over the years .
they sure can . maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes .	i just love dolphins	they are kind of like our friends	did you know sharks scared off doliphins ?	i have a collection of dolphin figurines
the park will close soon . we should better go in right now .	your welcome	have a great day	enjoy the show	have a great day
really ?	yeah , let's go then !	then let us go !	let's go !	yeah , i know .

it is a new park , isn't it ?	ok , i'll follow you .	lead the way .	yeah , i don't want to miss the good rides .	sounds good to me .
yes , how do you know ?	yes , it just opened last month .	no , it's been here for the last few years at least .	i'm not sure , but i'm excited to check it out !	i think it's older , but they've added some new attractions !
i guessed it .	it looks new .	i read about it online .	the rides are super tech - heavy .	my uncle walt designed it .
well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .	you're lying . how did you know really ?	oh yeah sure you guessed it . sigh . . .	ok whatever . just meet me there .	sure you did . why do i even ask ?
oh , how wonderful !	that's sounds nice !	i agree with you !	yes , that's right .	yes , i know .
thank you , mr . johnson .	thank you , i appreciate it .	thank you . i was hoping to talk to lisa later .	thank you , i'll be out of your way by dinnertime .	i appreciate it . i have something that i want to share with lisa .
please , just call me tom .	what's for dinner ?	make myself at home ? thanks ! ( turns on kinky porn channel ) .	this conversation sounds like it came straight out of " leave it to beaver " and o	why do i feel like eddie haskell at this moment .
okay , tom .	it was really nice of you to invite me over .	sorry . i will from now on , tom .	ok , tom . and you can always call me mary .	sorry , tom . and thank you again for the hospitality .
where's cindy ?	thank you !	anyways , what should we talk about next ?	thank you for that !	i want to thank you !
she's upstairs in my room .	she is cooking too .	cindy is not here .	i do not know where cindy is now .	call her phone to see where she is .
can you tell her to come downstairs ? we're about to have dinner .	how has she been feeling lately .	will she join us soon ?	what do you want to see mary about ?	can i get you anything ?
no , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells .	i know , right ? of all people .	wish i was kidding . he's such a suck - up .	yes , i'm kidding of course . he was fired .	got you ! april fool's !
oh , i don't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years .	that's insane !	why would they do that !	i deserve it more !	that's not fair !
well , it's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul .	i know a lot people better than paul .	i'm happy for paul .	how many years does it take for a person to get a promotion .	two years is way faster than most promotions .
well . good for him .	well , i hope it works out .	this could be a disaster .	some people are going to be upset by this .	i guess everybody has a chance then .
ok , let's go .	ok give me a few minutes .	sounds good lets go .	do you mind if we have lunch first .	ok , and after we can go out to dinner .
the competition will begin in 5 minutes , it's tense here .	then let us go !	we will go then !	ok , let's see it !	that's a great idea !
wonderful , bruce is taking the lead .	it must be so nerve - wracking to be an athlete .	imagine how hard it is to focus for them .	they have to keep warming up . else they'll get cold .	yeah , but it's fun . i love competition .
other competitors have almost caught up with him . they are neck and neck .	you are right .	that's correct .	i know he is .	great observation .
come on , bruce . come on , bruce .	but he is still on the lead	so far he is doing well	they seem faster than him	do you think he will continue leading ?
wow , bruce crossed the line first .	you can do it !	kick hard and finish !	i think bruce will win	oh no , he got passed !
in the van .	at my friend's house .	i can organize that	we can find a cheap hotel .	we can do camping
what about other expenses ?	i've slept in the van before i guess	who wants to sleep in a van ?	that sounds like a blast	well , i did nt think of that
let's see . gas , food , recreation , we won't spend much . come on . don't hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard , haven't we ?	i'll take care of them .	don't worry about it .	it'll be fine .	trust me , please .
maybe you're right . when do you plan to go ?	i'm just trying to be realistic .	you're not being realistic . i hate how i am always the bad cop .	that doesn't mean we can afford a vacation , george .	i am sick of this conversation , george .
the sooner the better ! i can't wait !	let's go to a few state parks and get out in nature .	i was thinking we'd leave next thursday .	let's take off next friday , and then we can spend the weekend traveling .	i think we could do it in a couple weeks .
oh , i don't know where we're going yet .	i think this is a bad idea , but it is up to you .	we need to save up a little more before we can go on vacation .	you are such a bad influence on me .	we can all use a vacation , but we do not have enough money .
as long as we're going , you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food , so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time .	we can make it up as we go . it'll be fun	you're going to loose all that vacation time anyway . why not ?	where would you like to go ?	would you rather plan some other vacation ?
let's go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field !	thanks !	oh , i love chinese food !	i can't wait , let's go .	let us go then .
you have such good ideas !	sounds great . i haven't been to chicago for awhile .	awesome . maybe we can get pizza one day .	i'll check when the games are .	super ! lets start packing .
i will be there half an hour early .	that's great !	that's perfect , actually .	ok , then .	then that's that .
you might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on december 8th . do you have a ride ?	perfect . that gives us plenty of time .	ok . i'm counting on you .	please be there . you can't be late again .	ok , i will pencil you in for 6:30
yes , someone is picking me up .	yes , my sister is giving me a ride .	yes , my mom can pick me up .	no , do you know anyone looking to carpool ?	no , could i ride with you ?
to get back to campus by 8	did you bring all the things you need ?	okay make sure to be careful while on your trip .	alright have fun and behave .	if you ever need help , do not hesitate to contact me .
not at the moment -- maybe later , though .	yes , i've got a ride and room for 2 more if needed	i'm all set . you can come with me if you'd like .	can i bring snacks on the bus for the ride ?	how many duffle bags can i bring ?
all of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . see you on monday !	yes , i know .	you don't need to tell me twice .	i've got it .	i know , okay ?
no , in most cases i don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . i work five days a week .	only on special occasions but i like it	sometimes . it depends on our caseload really .	just during the tax season .i don't mind .	yes but i really enjoy it .
do you enjoy work here ?	that's nice !	i like that !	tell me more !	that's not too bad , i guess .
it is hard to say . but i've to start by working as a trainee before i really become an experienced marketing assistant . sometimes , i am really under great pressure when it gets busy .	yes , it is very interesting .	yes , the people are very nice .	yes , i plan to stay for awhile .	yes , i have learned a lot .
take it easy . i'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . i hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job .	that's a lot of responsibility . i'm impressed .	do you want to have your entire career here ?	did you go to school for marketing ?	are you in line for a promotion ?
luckily not . the silent i meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss .	i have not had any trouble at all .	all jobs come with some trouble .	i sure will take it easy and there is no trouble here .	i can not wait to be a better marketing assistant .
glad to hear that .	that is nice , they should do well to put you through things thoroughly then	what are your future plans in the company ?	i hope you are managing the stress well ?	is it possible for you to share little ideas about this marketing stuff when you are less busy ?
it's exciting news ! if we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth !	it's too soon to tell .	that we found it at all is good news don't you think ?	i think it's terrible news	i guess its great news since we've just about destrayed this planet
you mean with people on it ?	would that be good news or bad news ?	that might be good or bad .	i don't know .	maybe , but not likely .
yes ! isn't that exciting ?	or aliens .	anything is possible .	there could be !	who knows ?
ok . maybe you should invite your sister along , too .	newspaper ? lol . i haven't read one in years .	i don't get one . i'll check online .	ok , let me check and i'll get back to you .	hmmm , nothing but superhero movies . not interested .
no it's not . it's just funny .	dude , you got a problem with estrogen ?	tuesday isn't just for tacos and ally mcneal -- it's transvestite night at my place .	oh come on , put on a frilly dress and we'll get zonked on chardonnay !	i need a change of pace after watching football all day .
yeah , if you're a girl .	it's still a girl's show .	not even .	i don't think so .	you're so wrong there .
well , you just want to watch dark angel because of the hot girl .	so guys aren't allowed to watch it ?	but i'm a guy and i like it .	you need to open your mind .	or a guy . why so judgmental ?
that's not true . dark angel is a good show .	you got me there .	who wouldn't want to see a hot girl on television	so what ?	it's better than your girly show .
it's story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits .	it's okay .	it has its moments .	we can record it .	i haven't watched it in awhile .
o . k . , o . k . let's forget it . there's a football game on too .	yeah , like ally mcneal is never in tight outfits .	she's not even my favorite character on the show !	wow , i didn't realize petty jealousy was your thing .	the plot is like 10 times better than ally mcneal !
no way . i'm watching ally mcneal . go to john's to watch the game .	no , lets watch your shows .	it okay to like a girl's show .	who playing in the game ?	okay but record my show for me .
what did you buy ?	did you get that new sweater ?	what stores were open ?	aren't you supposed to be saving money ?	does rick know you went shopping again ?
i bought this coat . do you like it ?	just some groceries .	the usual stuff .	i bought this pair of shoes i've had my eyes on for a while now .	i bought a few presents . a family birthday is coming up soon .
yeah , i like it a lot . it's very pretty . where did you buy it ?	yes , it's great .	the color really suits you .	i do .	i love it .
at the mall on 5th street .	i got it at the new store at the mall .	it was in a cool little retro shop i found .	i went to a discount store and found it mixed it with all the cheap stuff .	it was the only one in the store . it was on display on a mannequin .
was it expensive ?	is that all you brought ?	how much was the coat ?	i think i will go buy me one .	how do you like the mall on 5th street ?
no , it wasn't expensive . it was on sale for 20 dollars .	everything on 5th street is expensive .	yes , can't you tell ?	yes but i got it on sale cheap .	no it was on clearance .
that's cheap .	that's a great deal !	how did you find out about that deal ?	are you kidding me ! ? it looks so elegant .	were there more than one ? i want it !
i know . it was a really good deal .	yes , it was a great deal .	i know . i really got lucky .	it was originally 100 .	yep , they were trying to clear out inventory .
i don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . it's been really hot lately .	i also bought some shoes .	we should go shopping there together next week .	what did you do today ?	want to go get some coffee ?
really ? what's the matter ?	what's the problem ?	is something wrong ?	it's your call .	you sound off .
i don't know . i'm just feeling a little sad .	i think i'm catching a cold .	i have a lot of other stuff to do .	i just don't feel like it .	i'm not in the mood .
listen . come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner .	is everything ok at home ?	do you want to talk about it ?	why ? did something happen ?	can i help ?
now that's a good idea . thanks a lot , brian . i'm feeling better already .	ok that might make be feel better .	no thank you i'm going home .	i do not feel like learning right now .	can you take notes for me , i really need to go home .
i don't care . i want to burn up my fat .	i jog fast .	i don't like to jog slow .	i love to race .	you'll get better at it with practice .
but running so fast is not good for people over forties .	then don't expect me to keep up !	then how are we going to cross the finish line together ?	ok then i'm not holding back next time we play tennis .	fair enough . i'll try my hardest .
why ?	it won't kill me .	i'll be fine .	it's not that old .	let's just keep a good pace then .
we are not as athletic as we were when young . mild exercise is more suitable for us .	i just made that up to get you to slow down for me .	because it is hard on the joints .	i don't know actually i just read it in a magazine .	we are at high risk for a heart attack .
but i want to burn up more calories !	mild doesn't work to get rid of fat .	well i want to lose weight fast , not slowly .	i have never done anything slow , including this .	young smoung , i'm fine to jog fast .
in fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time .	you are going to get a heart attack at this rate !	slow down please , i can't run as fast .	i can't feel my legs anymore	slow down or i am leaving you .
really ? i will slow down then .	where did you learn this ?	i still think running faster is better .	okay i will listen to you on this .	how long of time to i need to go to burn fat ?
yeah , you are right i used to not watch horror films , but after seeing silence of the lamb with mike last month , i fell in love with them .	i like the blood and guts .	i like being scared .	don't you like them ?	i like predicting who will be the next victim .
it's amazing . but if i were you , i wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one .	oh i can't bring myself to watch that movie .	i don't like horror movies at all , they give me nightmares .	how can you sleep after watching those ?	i give you credit for being brave enough to watch them .
but it's really exciting .	we should watch a horror film together .	horror films are the only movies that get me excited nowadays	you should watch it , you will fall in love with horror films too .	i can show you why horror films are the best .
maybe , but i would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . i wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one .	i do not think they are for me .	i'm going to give horror movies another try .	i'm glad one of us has the courage .	i never watched horror movies as a kid .
basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror .	luckily they do not impact my sleep !	mike really likes them too so it is a good way for us to spend time together .	crime movies creep me out ! horror movies do not seem as realistic to me . i can't watch crime movies .	have you watched the netflix movie with sandra bullock , it is more supernatural than horror . you might enjoy it .
yep .	yea horror is scary	yes i never do horror .	i can never watch it	that is it
i think you should have a try someday . maybe you'll change your mind .	that s ok , i'll watch them for you	i will watch them with you and cover your eyes for the scary parts for you	they get predictable after a while but sometimes there s a really deep plot twist	i'm sorry you get so afraid . i can snuggle with you and keep you safe
maybe . after all , i am grown up now .	what would you recommend starting with ?	well , i haven't tried one in awhile .	ugh , i wouldn't be able to sleep that night .	maybe .
thanks a lot . i'm so touched .	i am sure i will , thank you for thinking of me .	that is very thoughtful of you , thank you !	fairy flowers always does nice work . i am sure they will be beautiful .	thank you for the wishes and the flowers . how kind of you !

that's terrific !	wow , congrats .	and i was nt invited .	three kids , wow .	you ve been quite busy .
that's great !	lucky you .	sounds like a pain to me .	i dunno if i want to live with that many people .	good luck living with girls .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?	why do nt you eat meat ?	so you re not a vegan ?	meat is good for you .	you do nt know what you re missing .
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .	i love vegetables .	i'm more of a fruit person .	i get the daily recommend amount of vegetables .	i could add more vegetables to my diet .
what do you drink ?	i like fruit , but vegetables are my favorite .	we have the best peaches in our town .	fruit is so acidic it bothers me sometimes .	fruit is good for you so you must be healthy .
well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .	lots and lots of water .	i have at least one smoothie a day .	protein shakes are my go to drink .	a combination of water and electrolytes .
well , you might pinch your eyelid ! or lose an eyeball !	it just doesn't look safe .	that just looks like a weird tool to me .	i would never have guessed that was some kind of makeup tool .	i could never see myself using that thing .
it just makes my eyelashes curl upwards .	yeah , that doesn't happen .	never . i'm an old pro at this .	have you really not seen one before ?	i'll be fine .
well , congratulations . when is the big date ?	well it's absolutely lovely !	have you picked out your wedding ring yet ?	when's the big day ?	where are you getting married at ?
in june .	it's on july 20 !	the wedding isn't until next june .	thank you . it's coming up next month !	we haven't set a date , yet .
did you have the watch before getting the ring ?	i'll be there .	will i be invited ?	can i come ?	i can come right ?
actually , we bought the ring together after i got the watch .	no , i bought it to match .	yes , my grandmother gave it to me .	yes , it is a family heirloom .	no , it is new .
you did a fabulous job with the selection . it's gorgeous .	did he get a watch as well ?	did you get a matching ring on purpose ?	well , they really compliment one another .	nothing like getting engaged in style !
thank you so much .	it wasn't that expensive either .	would you like to know where i got it ?	are you a watch collector ?	i will tell my fiance how much you liked it .
what kind of watch is it ?	may i ask you where you bought them ?	your fiance must be quite a guy .	have you set a wedding date ?	i wish you all the best for your future .
it's a tag heer .	it's a seiko !	it's a swiss watch -- i don't much care about brand names .	it's a rolex !	it's a brand i had never heard of , but i love the style and it keeps good time !
if you don't mind me asking , how much do they cost ?	i'd love one of those .	great brand .	i own one too .	my husband knows watches and he says those are one of the best .
this one is $ 1500 . but they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 .	i don't recall , but it was pretty pricey .	one like this cost almost five hundred dollars .	they're normally pretty expensive , but i got it on sale for two hundred dollars .	it was actually a gift . i'm not sure how much it cost .
that's why it looks so nice . i should have figured . you always get what you pay for .	i'm thinking about getting my daughter one for her college graduation .	oh my , that's way out of my budget .	well , it's best to pay for quality , i think .	i'm going to put one of those on my christmas wish list !
yeah . i would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones .	yes quality costs	what other watch brands do you enjoy ?	thank you for the kind compliment	i look forward to my wedding i m so excited
come on . for a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . since you're so successful , it must be the latter .	something's wrong , i can tell .	you can tell me . i won't share with anyone else .	well , if you want to talk about it , i'm here for you .	i don't believe that ! let me help you .
well , you're right . i just broke up with jane .	really ? there are more reasons than two why i might feel down .	i'm not sure about either of those choices .	no , i've just not been feeling well and it's discouraging i'm not improving faster .	well , if you must know , i suffer at times with depression .
oh , i'm sorry . i thought you two were made for each ocher .	that's so sad !	what happened ?	why did you break up ?	tell me more !
well , you never know . i'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young .	guess not .	she didn't think so .	yeah , some time these things just don't work out .	we had been having problems for awhile .
well , she is not to blame . it's always difficult to choose between career and family .	and you guys couldn't come up with a compromise ?	at least she was up front and honest about it .	on the bright side , neither one of you got stuck in something they didn't plan on .	that's rough , but you'll find someone else .
maybe you're right .	we were together so long . i thought she was ready .	she is to blame . whose side are you on .	i guess i'm just being selfish .	i don't think i can live without her .
jack , i don't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate , your perfect match !	i think she should focus on her career .	you should try to compromise with jane .	yes , i know i am right .	i know jane very well and i know what she wants .
yeah , but it's hard to forget her at moment . you know , we were together for almost five years . it's really hard . . .	well , maybe you and i should go fishing , lol .	well , that was a really nice fish that got away .	say , you feel like going out for a drink ?	women sure are more independent these days .
what is the score ?	that's great news !	isn't that great !	i think that's so cool !	that is simply amazing .
china beat brazil three to zero .	i don't remember .	36 - 10 .	11 - 10 . it was a close game .	12 - 4 . they really crushed it .
wonderful .	they are on a roll !	oh man , i thought brazil would put up more of a fight .	do you know who they play next ?	do you think they'll go all the way ?
ouch .	ouch .	wow . after being burned like that , no wonder he wouldn't go for that again .	wow . that's a hard lesson .	can't blame him for not wanting to go through that again .
now he only works freelance . hundred bucks an hour .	yeah , a year of their life with nothing to show for it .	i don't even know how something like that is legal .	i'd be pretty hesitant if that happened to me , too .	he barely recovered from it .
perfect . it will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people .	fantastic ! are you available tomorrow morning to start planning ?	i heard that about you !	that's great ! i really need help planning .	ok . . . "party " !
will it be an all day event ?	oh , i don't know a ton about parties that big .	i can get started on finding some ideas .	are we allowed to serve alcohol ?	do people have to pay to get in or is it free ?
yes . and we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library .	it is a 5 hour event	it is an all day event	yes , that's the plan	i think so
that was quick thinking .	have you figured out food yet ?	what sort of music are you looking for ?	are there going to be party games ?	what types of people do you anticipate ?
isn't that a silly question ? you know how much of an athlete i am .	yes . how awesome is that ! ?	of course it's waterproof !	that's one of the things that makes it so cool .	you bet it is !
uh , huh . . . so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ?	it was an easy question ?	how much did you pay for the watch ?	where can i buy this watch ?	what kind of sports do you do ?
well , surfing , scuba diving . . .	swimming	water polo	triathlon	scuba diving
that's much more convenient . we don't even have to bring the flavorings .	i feel we should be a little better prepared .	i think we should carry some stuff to eat and drink .	yeah but we will need to carry food and drinks .	sounds good . we will see you there .
there you go ! daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming .	i could never do any of that .	i can't imagine the stress it causes .	i barely finish sudoku pzzles .	how much money do they make ?
that's my boy ! katherine curtis created this activity in 1920 . and in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in olympic games .	yeah , they do it in the olympics .	we should look up some videos of it online after this .	do you want to go see that next time ?	i just love all the ways humans have learned to use their bodies .
wow , mom is more knowledgeable than dad . i must learn from you .	it's very beautiful to watch .	do you think i could try it ?	are there any boy's teams ?	how many countries have synchronized swimming teams at the olympics ?
my little boy , you should learn more from me . i'm almost thirty years older than you .	mom knows quite a bit , too !	mom taught dad everything he knows about it .	i've just been very interested in this topic for a long time .	dad knows more about some things than i do .
ok , you're the boss . look , mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool .	that's a lot of time .	i promise to listen to you more .	there is so much to learn .	what else do you want to teach me ?
oh , my god . it's so dangerous . and he might break his leg . you mustn't do anything like that .	he is the lead dancer .	now watch closely what he does next .	sometimes other people just want to ruin the show .	look how he did not even make a splash .
you mean that you can them .	i don't think that's what ufos means .	have you seen one ?	why do you think they are real ?	i would have an easier time believing if i saw one .
that's right . i can see them in my dreams .	they are waiting for the right time .	we can't be all alone out there .	no , but i still believe .	you don't have to see something for it to be true .
they come to the earth ?	how many times have you seen them ?	dreams did not count .	i wish i could see them in my dreams .	are they scary in your dreams ?
no . their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space .	yes they invade earth and kill everyone .	yes they came to earth , but they did not hurt anyone .	nope . they were traveling around space looking for resources .	they came to talk with us humans .
aliens from the outer space ? do you talk to them ? what do they look like ?	why would they want to come here ?	what do they want with us ?	how do they send them ?	where are they from ?
ok , ok , one by one , please ! they look like robots , but they can speak . their mission is to make friends with human beings .	they look different to whomever they decide to approach .	it's part of their plan , no one can remember .	they walk among us , we can never be sure where or who they are .	whatever your mind decides they look like .
that means that you talk to them ? in which language ?	i see . . . and they made friends with you ?	do they look like us , or do they look like tv characterizations of aliens ?	how is it they know english ?	why don't they appear to everyone if their mission is to make friends ?
of course in english , they learn english on mars too .	they have their own language , but they're able to communicate in english .	i'll have to ask them the next time i see them .	they've spent years studying us . they can speak using all human languages .	they typically use english , but they're familiar with all of our languages .
wow . sounds fantastic !	do they know any other languages besides english ?	i would think that the aliens would have an alien dialect or an alien language to speak in too .	have you ever spoken to one of the aliens ? if so , what did you ask or say to them ?	how often do you speak to them and how do you know they are fluent in english ?
of course not . i just thought the movie was . . . boring .	no , it was super boring .	not really . it just didn't go anywhere .	i little . it had some creepy aesthetics .	no , i just regret wasting that much time .
boring ? come on , you clutched to my arm all the time .	oh . . . i thought it was scary .	yeah , it was a little slow paced .	it had it's good points , but it did seem to drag on .	i was disappointed too .
well , i admit . the ghosts were scary .	ok , i was a little bit scared .	i just love being close to you !	i was trying not to fall asleep !	i did not . . . you were clutching my arm .
i like scary movies .	i agree .	really ? you're scared of ghosts of all things ?	how about the monster ?	i didn't like them either .
that's gucci's influence . i love science fiction movies !	are you sure the movie was scary , besides just the ghosts ? i really didn't think so .	i think we should go see a really scary movie this weekend . i know just the movie !	if you like scary movies , have i got the movie for you !	that movie was no way scary , maybe more of a thriller or a drama , not a horror story .
of course you do . they are silly stories just for little kids like you .	i like good scary movies and unfortunately , this one was bad .	how do you know so much about gucci ?	we should have seen a science fiction movie then i like those better than scary movies .	next time we should see a science fiction movie then .
don't call me kid . i am a grownup .	take that back !	that's rude , may .	why are you giving me such a hard time ?	maybe so , but i love them .
do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ?	i am sorry for calling you a kid .	i am sorry for calling you a kid .	i didn't know you were a grownup .	how old are you ?
of course ! i can watch them without you !	i do dare . . . but next week i get to choose the genre of a movie we watch ok ?	i don't want to watch any more of this type of movie . . . no offense to you though .	i would love to watch a comedy with you !	how about a nice documentary ?
oh , really ?	if you say so !	well then , let's meet up at 8:00 pm !	lets go see the new saw movie then !	try not to clutch my arm this time haha .
you really are lucky !	oh , it must be so helpful for you !	oh , what did your mother do ?	that's great -- it's nice to have family watch babies .	what a great arrangement for your mom to be able to spend so much time with him .
yeah , i know .	totally !	having the extra help is really nice .	she really makes my day a lot easier .	i'm really thankful for her help .
sorry . i'm strictly a spectator - football , baseball , basketball , golf . . . i watch them all .	oh , i really haven't played a game since i was a kid . when would you like to get together ?	yes , i would like to have play a game soon , how about next weekend ?	how good a tennis player are you ? i will play a game with you if i know what i am up against .	i am a bit rusty at tennis . you also mentioned that you are a good tennis player . how good of a player are you ?
what's on ?	did you like the movie ?	what movie did you see ?	did you eat any popcorn ?	did you eat any popcorn ?
paris in the spring .	there is a great new adventure playing	there is a great new romantic movie playing	there is a great new love story playing	there is a great new boxing movie playing
oh , i've already seen it . i saw it on television last year . it's an old film , but it's very good .	was it any good ?	how did you like it ?	is it something i would like ?	how busy was the cinema when you were there ?
paris is a beautiful city . i have never been there . have you ever been there , ken ?	do nt tell me how it ends .	glad you liked it .	great to hear .	how old is it ?
yes , i have . i was there in april .	yes , to paris . i have an uncle who is an engineer who lives in the city .	yes , to stay with relatives who are parisans .	yes , i stay with family when i visit each year .	yes , and i am going this year . however , with the political climate , i might not this year .
paris in the spring , eh ?	how nice were the parisians ?	how was the weather while you were there ?	did you see any beautiful french people ?	what restaurants did you eat at ?
it was spring , but the weather was awful . it rained all the time .	that's some coincidence .	i might head back there some day .	you should visit sometime .	were you thinking of taking a vacation to paris ?
just like dear old london !	just like spring here !	what a shame !	spring is always a bit unpredictable , i guess .	i hope it didn't ruin your time there .
i want to know what it says .	wow congratulations !	so it says you were accepted ?	where you expecting that so soon ?	i didn't know you were expecting that !
they didn't accept me .	its none of your business .	like i would tell you .	its says i got in .	i was nt accepted .
are you serious ?	oh ! i am so sorry !	what a disappointment for you !	you'll get into a better school - just wait and see !	man , that sucks ! i know how much you wanted to go there .
it's the truth .	yes i am serious , i my application was rejected .	i am sure even if i did nt get in here it means there is a better opportunity out there .	no , i am just kidding with you , i got in .	they said the reason i did nt get in was my grade point average was nt high enough .
are you okay ?	i'm so sorry . there are still the others so don't get too discouraged .	i'm very surprised . do they give a reason or is it just a generic letter ?	i wish there was something i could say . i hope you don't let this stop you from trying as hard as you have been .	before you get too down , remember you have applications in a lot of schools . you'll be accepted soon .
i really wanted to get into nyu .	i'm so mad ! !	devastated !	what am i going to do now ?	i feel so sad .
i am really sorry to hear that .	i'm so sorry .	there are better school for you .	why do you think you were not accepted ?	i know you did , lets figure out a plan for you .
it's okay . i'm still waiting to hear from ucla anyway .	thank you .	i might have to reapply	thank you , i just do not know what to do jow	ugh its just not fair
i remember my first break up . it was the worst feeling in the world . i was crying everyday for three months . and slowly , it got better . i know you'll feel better too .	what happened ?	i'm really sorry .	is there anything i can do ?	do you want to talk about it ?
you've been through this too ?	i do nt want to hear about your breakup .	thanks , that s what i wanted hear .	i do nt care all that much about your breakup .	are you being serious right now ?
yeah . i remember it very clearly . the pain makes it easy to remember . i know you're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups .	unfortunately yes . but it does get better , i promise .	yeah - it sucked , and still does in some ways , but it gets easier .	oh , yeah , big time . it was horrible for a while . i let myself fell bad for a little while , then i forced myself to move on . it took a while , but things are great now .	yes , and i learned a lot from it .
but it hurts too much .	i am sure many have gone through this , i know i am not the only one .	i am sorry you had to go through this before too .	what were the things you did to get over it ?	thanks for your concern i really appreciate it and i know it will get better .
i know it's painful , but it's only temporary . after the pain goes away , you'll find other girls .	i know it does and it will for awhile . but , believe me , it will get better as time goes by .	i do understand . right now if feels like the end of the world but soon , you'll be able to move on .	try to keep yourself busy and you won't have as much time to think about it . trust me , we'll be talking about this in a few months and everything will be a lot better .	it does , i know . but someday , as bad as it feels now , it will be a distant memory and you won't think about it as much .
what if i don't want to find another girl ?	it sure doesn't seem as though it will go away .	i just want to hide away .	i think i'll get drunk .	thanks for the comforting thoughts . you're a real friend .
you'll change your mind . look at everyone in the world . they all break up and move on . the faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover .	do not worry you will .	give it some time and you will feel better .	worry about working on yourself for now .	i do not think that has ever happen to anyone .
you're right .	aw thank you for the advice	idk she was just so special	you ca nt guarentee that !	i hope i do i do nt what to be alone forever
i also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . you know she didn't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ?	like i said , i've been through this before .	i'm here for you whenever you feel like talking .	i wish i could do more to help you .	try to get some rest because it will help you to think more clearly .
yeah . thanks for the talk .	no , i need to find someone better	yes , i love her	you are right , i am going out tonight and finding someone new	you are right , i should stop acting like a baby
i'll give you a call later . we should hang out . it's good to be around people .	you're welcome .	you bet . i'm here for you .	i'm always willing to listen .	of course . whenever you need me i'm here .
ok . i'll talk to you later .	i appreciate your encouragement .	can we get together later today ?	i'd like that . you're uplifting to be around .	that sounds good , just don't bring anybody for me to meet right now .
i think he's got too much on his plate .	i do not think he can .	it is too much work for him .	he is getting behind on the task .	it is a lot work for one person .
yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower !	is it really safe there ?	i don't think i'll be able to hit any targets .	i don't know if i can actually pull the trigger .	i just really don't like guns at all .
whoa , take it easy there rambo . don't get carried away . these weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . for example , never handle a weapon that you haven't inspected yourself . always make sure there isn't anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot !	settle down rambo , we'll just shoot my guns	you can rent a shotgun at the range	i don't think they have flame throwers	yeah , that would be cool if we could
wow , i didn't know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies !	i wasn't being serious .	i was kidding .	okay , i'll just try out your gun first .	i'll dial my enthusiasm back a bit . let's go !
the reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ?	that's because they know the safety rules .	it is cool as long as you are responsible .	i'll teach you how to be responsible and safe with them first .	are you sure you ready for this ?
let's do it !	yes , i think i'm ready .	i want to be safe . can you teach me how to inspect the weapons ?	yes , i'm so excited . let's go .	yes , can i try the easiest weapon first ?
a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday .	oh no . if you ever want to talk , i'm here .	sounds like you're fed up .	want to grab a drink sometime ? i know things can be stressful .	don't worry , you'll get through it .
it wasn't always like this , you know .	don't we all ? i'm no more stressed than usual .	would you be willing to treat ? i need to save money and get out of debt .	would you come with me ? i hate to vacation alone .	i have one planned . a trip to italy for two . i can't wait .
what do you mean ?	i know , you have been under a lot of stress lately .	looking your spouse really changes your outlook on life .	i know , what can i do for you ?	i know , things just have to get better for you .
well , i mean . we always do the same thing . there's no variety in our lives .	i used to be happy	i don't know i guess i'm just down	just wishing things were the way they used to be	i don't know maybe you're right i need a holiday . maybe i need a break from life .
you need a holiday . that's what's the matter .	so you are bored with us is what you are saying ?	i'm surprised you feel that way !	since when ? we just took that cooking class last month .	well , i try to get you to do new things with me but your always too busy .
certainly , perhaps .	i ca nt afford a holiday .	i do nt have the money .	not everyone is as free as you .	wanna pay for it ?
what a bummer ! you set me up ?	why did you do all of this ? i would have gone out with you , if you'd asked .	is this some kind of a joke ? what's with the act ?	you are too much ! what else do you have in mind for the evening ?	i should have known . i owe you a good prank now .
let me explain . i didn't mean to hurt you . . .	it was the only way i could get you to go out with me .	wow , i didn't think you would be this disappointed .	i guess i did , can we try to have a fun night .	april's fool !
how dare you ! ( starts to walk off )	well , you did	you better have a good explanation .	i am so hurt , how could you do this to me ?	no . i don't even want to talk to you right now .
hang on one second . hear me out , just this once , isabella !	i just had to see you again .	i knew you wouldn't meet with me any other way .	i m sorry ! this was a mistake .	wait ! just hear me out !
why did you lie to me in the email ?	no way i m listening to you .	nope , i m off .	you had your chance .	like i m gon na stand here and talk to you .
i didn't lie . you just didn't ask me my real name .	i just wanted a chance to explain .	i wanted to talk to you in person to show you how sincere i am .	i needed to be able to show you this in person .	because i needed to apologize to you in person .
i should have known it was you . no wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . i thought i might have found the one for me .	oh , so it's my fault ?	what difference does that make ?	you still set me up and i hate you for it !	you pretended to be someone else ! i say again , how dare you ! !
i'm sorry . it was cruel of me . but i promise it will never happen again ? look , there's a nice restaurant . let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over .	what makes you think you haven't ?	i know you're upset , but there is something you need to know .	you have , but are too stubborn to realize it .	no one is good enough for you , but i might be the closest thing .
do you eat a lot of vegetables ?	how many sweets do you eat ?	what kind of job do you have ?	how much weight do you want to loose ?	are you a couch potato ?
oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit .	yes i do eat lots of veggies	i do i love vegetables .	not really . i haven't found any i like	no , but i'm working on eating more
what do you drink ?	do you try to keep your carb within a healthy range ?	have you ever been on a fad diet ?	how often do you treat yourself to junk of any sort ?	have you ever considered any other forms of exercise ?
well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you .	only water .	water and fresh juice .	i only drink coconut water .	i only drink filtered water .
what do you drink ?	do you like juice ?	i admire such dedication to a healthy lifestyle .	how much rest do you get each night ?	do you take any vitamins ?
what was the score ?	yes ! go china !	dang . i lost the bet .	oh okay just curious	okay thanks ! i was hoping they would win
china beat brazil 3 to 0 .	score was 3 - 2 china	4 - 2 , you missed a great game !	the score was 2 - 1 , it went into overtime !	ummm , 4 - 3 or something . i was so mad i didn't really pay attention .
wonderful !	are you serious ?	man , what an upset .	i did nt realize they were so good .	were they favored to win ?
it's not as simple as that . people judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . so dressing professional is being professional . the image that you portray to others is so important in business . it's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale .	fair enough .	i don't really disagree , but i think that being nicely dressed would be a bonus .	yeah , but people who are dressed more formally are generally viewed as more trustworthy and competent .	it might be a tad bit overrated , but it is still important .
maybe you're right , but i'll take my sneakers and jeans any day !	i guess that makes sense , just wish it wasn't such a big deal .	have they ever done studies to show what appearance customers prefer ?	i have heard people say the same thing about why they dress up to go to their jobs .	the way people make decisions when purchasing something always amazes me .
and your parents took it badly ?	ah , i can see your parents being upset about that !	how long has your sister been dating her boyfriend ?	are your parents still paying for the dormitory ? i could see them being upset about that .	do your parents like her boyfriend ?
that's putting it mildly . my father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her .	they went off the rails with her on the phone .	they don't approve of her boyfriend .	they think she is rushing into a relationship .	they think she is no longer taking her schooling seriously .
ouch , that sounds bad . what did your sister do ?	that must have been awful .	is your sister alright ?	did your parents ever calm down ?	did you say anything to her ?
she started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . my dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away .	i'm sorry they reacted poorly .	wow this is all a big surprise .	my sister cried all night .	my sister decided she wanted to move away .
how long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?	really wow .	i would have stayed quiet .	that s a bit harsh do nt you think .	why would she say anything .
three years . they've been dating since freshman year . they're even talking about marriage .	i have no idea .	about six months . it's too soon .	three weeks . can you imagine ?	not long enough to be playing house .
really ? then i guess living together would be a good idea .	three years ? your parents sound pretty old fashioned .	oh wow , sounds really serious . i think it was fine her moving in if they have been together that long .	and what do you think about the situation ?	i see . do you think they will get married ?
what do you mean ?	it's her life . she can do what she wants .	i don't see why my parents are so worried about it .	she's an adult . she can make her own decisions .	it's the best way to find out if they're truly compatible .
well , these days too many people are getting divorced . if they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not .	living together is the step between long term dating and marriage .	if they're considering marriage , it's good for them to see if they are compatible living together first .	moving in together can help with household expenses .	it sounds serious , so why not move in together to see if they like it ?
i guess so . better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out .	they don't make enough money to live together .	he doesn't want to live with her yet he likes his roommates too much .	if they move in together his family will stop paying his tuition .	living together has been a bad idea all they do is fight .
you're right . he sure is .	i like him too .	she is very happy with him .	she loves him very much .	he will make a wonderful husband .
that's a good idea . let's go !	yes , i would really like that .	i don't feel like getting bundled up .	can we build a snowman instead ?	i'd rather stay inside by the fireplace .
what a heavy snow ! look ! the water is frozen .	do you know where my boots are ?	let me grab my coat .	i hope it's good snowball snow !	want to build a snowman too ?
take care ! don't slip on the ground .	i wish we had ice skates !	do you think the ice is thick enough to stand on ?	be careful ! the ice may be thin !	let's walk around the water . i don't want to accidentally get wet .
i've got it . i like the feeling of stepping on the ice .	i wore my slip - resistant boots .	i ski everywhere so i won't fall .	i'll be really careful don't worry .	i haven't fallen down in 12 years and it's not happening today .
yes . very wonderful .	me too ! it's almost like walking on water .	i love sliding across it .	come here and i'll push you on it !	i like the crackling sound it makes .
there is a snowman over there .	such a unique sensation .	it's unlike any other surface .	it's dangerous , yet exhilarating .	i could do this all day .
how lovely it is !	want to build one next to it ?	let's go take a look !	it feels like we're in a winter wonderland out here !	i've never built a snowman before . is it hard ?
why ?	is that on the south end ?	what am i supposed to do there ?	ok , that's for the advice !	oh yeah , now i remember .
you can get help there in dealing with the united states immigration and naturalization service ; you can find foreign student advisers .	so you can get the right books .	it's where you sign up for your dorm .	it's the best place to find maps of the campus .	you have to register your for your orientation there .
what kind of role do foreign student advisers play ?	thanks for the advice , mr . stone !	ah , that sounds like a good idea !	is there a parking garage nearby ?	what does a foreign student adviser do differently than a normal adviser ?
they'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you .	they can tell you what things you will need for living arrangements .	if you want to shop and get groceries , they can tell you where to go .	if you need help with paperwork , these advisers can assist in it .	overall , they are younger people who know what you are going through .
can we get any more help at the international center ?	ok , then , thanks for this information .	will they be able to set everything up in one day ?	do the foreign student advisors speak more than one language ?	can i accomplish this today ? do you know if they are open now ?
yes , a lot more . if you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student i d and social security number there . they will keep your documents up - to - date . they will offer an orientation program for new comers . they will also help you contact your department and registration office .	yes , i am recruiting new people to help you guys .	no , it's not in the budget for the year .	yes we are recruiting new volunteers right now .	i have to get approval from the board before we can get you more help .
i see . it must be worth going to .	thank you very much .	that sounds like a lot of hassle .	are they friendly ?	what are their hours of operation ?
besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . in cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the international center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year .	i would definitely check it out .	they are really there to help you .	i have heard great things from other international students who went to these advisers .	it will make the process smoother for you to have this support .
wonderful . it is a home for foreign students .	are there any groups specifically for pakistani students like me ?	thanks for the information . i'm sure i will be using these services a lot .	what are some of the major cultural events ?	i am definitely interested in getting involved in some of these activities .
it sure is . they also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . the center staff members are also friendly and helpful . everyone loves them .	it's a place to build a community for anyone that wants to learn about other cultures .	it's a place to facilitate cultural awareness and growth .	this is a resource for everyone who wants to learn about the world .	it is a center to help people meet new people and learn .
true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities .	yeah , that's inflation for ya .	it's so frustrating .	i try to cut back , but it can be really hard .	i know what you mean . they have a hiring / promotion freeze at my company , so i'm also stuck .
definitely . i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month .	we need to get a cost of living raise .	i wonder how long things can last like this .	pretty soon i'll have to start going to a public restroom to bathe .	i just want to afford cereal , and i can survive .
the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken .	hey , i have a suggestion with regards to getting food and clothing for free . have you tried the freecycles in your areas ?	i know a couple of dumpsters behind this mall that are always throwing away their unused merchandise and food . want to come along sometime ?	have you tried the aldi's grocery story yet ? there prices on food are much lower than regular stores . however , you can't use coupons here .	because of rising prices , i am always on the look out for free stuff that gets listed to craig's list . ever try to save money by looking at that section of craig's list ?
is that inflation ?	i only buy food on clearance to save money .	i stopped buy pork years ago it cost too much .	we only eat tofu as our protein it is very cheap .	if you stop eating pork and chicken you will save the most money .
inflation is more than just the rising prices , i guess . but the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation .	yes it is .	i'm not sure what it is but it's wrong .	no , it's not inflation .	i don't know what inflation means to be honest .
has the government taken some measures to curb it ?	so when that happens we'll really be in for it !	i hope it doesn't get much worse than this .	if things turn worse , people will start starving !	well i hope the central bank is trying to do something positive about this .
yes . the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy .	i don't think the government cares	i haven't heard of anything	not that i'm aware of	hopefully they will soon
but i'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy .	that is good that the government cares .	regulation never stops price hikes .	i hope this ban helps prices .	my prices are still going up even with the ban .
you said it . i think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending .	that's always a possibility .	they need to be careful about that , or people will start to get restless .	they really need to get the economy under control .	if it happens too much , it could be a disaster .
how ?	what else could i cut though ?	i'm already having a hard time making ends meet without tightening any more .	i'm not sure i can at this rate .	i hope we get some good news soon .
for a start , we can take the public transport to work . you know , running a car is a big expense .	just don't buy the most expensive cuts of meats .	make a budget and write everything you spend down in this book to track .	cook more at home , don't eat out at all and make most of the meals vegan or vegetarian dishes .	shop at thrift shops for clothing , and buy food in bulk for starters .
sounds a good idea .	i agree . do you know any other ways to get around for those without easy access to public transportation ?	public transportation might be difficult for someone that lives in a rural area .	i don't even have enough money to own a car .	do you know any other ways to cut expenses ?
the touchdown lines are there and there . ok , let's play !	don't get too rough , or you are kicked out .	remember to have fun and enjoy the game .	if the ball touches the ground , it is an incompletion .	seven people will be assigned to each team .
before we start , let's have a moment of silence for our fallen men .	you can not trip the person with the ball and wrestle to ball away from them , that is also a foul .	you can tackle them and then throw them to the ground to get the ball away from them .	at least you understand where the touch down lines are located , right ?	show me again where these touch down lines are on the screen for me .
great ! it's just like viewless stores . but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ?	do you think you could help me sell some stuff ?	do you think you could teach me how ?	do you think you could help me buy something ?	are you worried about getting ripped off ?
that's simple . just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . and the goods will be delivered to your place .	it's super easy to shop online their website is up to date .	you view the products in the store then finish the order online .	it's a surprise you never know what you might get online but it is fun .	you have to set up an account online then you can shop whenever you like .
is the service charged ?	wow , that's so convenient .	that's a super cool feature .	technology has gotten so advanced these days .	i just love all this technological progression .
no . it's free .	buyers aren't charged any extra fees unless there are applicable taxes you would pay normally at a store .	only sellers have to pay extra fees usually .	you may have to pay extra for shipping .	it is free to use if that is your concern .
really . i'll get a computer at once .	do you have to buy or spend a certain amount of money for the shipping to be free too ?	what do you mean by that ? what is " free ? "	can you clarify what you mean by it being free ?	is there some catch where it might not be free ?
thank you .	thanks for the advice .	i'll be sure to do that .	in the meantime , i guess i'll keep looking .	have you seen the conductor yet ?
