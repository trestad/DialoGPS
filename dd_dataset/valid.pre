some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . people spend so much time at work . it is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . <eou> if we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . <eou> beneficial ? i don ’ t think so . if two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . if they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . by any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . <eou> but if two employees are in love , they will be happy . happy people are more productive . if they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . it can help to improve work efficiency . <eou>
do you eat a lot of healthy food ? <eou> compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . and anyway , i believe if you live a low stress life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . it's all in the mind . <eou> you have the point . i think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . <eou> what's special about these things ? <eou>

what's our target audience for this campaign ? <eou> this go-around we're focusing on new moms , families with median income and one or more children under the age of two . <eou> do you think that's much different from the succor moms we tailored the last campaign for ? <eou> well , there are some similarities that come up . because both groups are made up of mothers ... so as before , we can play up on maternal instincts , hygiene , safety , along those lines . but that being said , there are some specific differences that come into play because we are dealing with mothers of infants here . <eou>
