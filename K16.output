T-524	it's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole <<unk>> of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing <<unk>> , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it's interesting to join them .

S-2681	totally agree . what is your solution ? <eou> well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy . <eou> you seem to have a very relaxed outlook . <eou> it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress . <eou> but i don't think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses . <eou>
T-2681	i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team .

S-2337	i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . <eou> i think most people are a little nervous about it . i was really very , very nervous just before i had the operation , but the <unk> gave me an <unk> and the next thing i remember was waking up after the operation . <eou> it must have really hurt afterwards . <eou> well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . i wasn't permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . that was the worse thing . <eou> i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . <eou>

S-2155	of course i'd come . i couldn't think of a better chance to see all my old friends . <eou> yeah . it's hard to believe that it's been ten years since graduation . it feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas . <eou> how time flies . but hey , how are things going with you ? <eou> oh , where to start ? there have been ups and downs . i'm still trying to find my place in this world . it's only recently that i've been able to start settling down . how about you ? you still with <unk> <eou> yeah , jenny and i got married right after graduation . it was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . i was supporting us both while she continued her studies . but now things are getting better <eou>
T-2155	oh , that sounds wonderful . i have always known you two would make it . i hope i can keep in better contact with you guys . i don't want us to drift apart again .

S-259	it's always easier to say something than to do it . <eou> it's not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the <unk> of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . <eou> but i love wearing t-shirts and jeans . <eou> i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as <unk> jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . <eou> it's a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes . <eou>

S-262	i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as <unk> jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . <eou> it's a pity that i cannot afford more expensive clothes . <eou> you misunderstood me . clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are <unk> or frivolous . <eou> i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time . <eou> you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . <eou>

S-256	so you'd better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . <eou> i'll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . <eou> that's right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . <eou> it's always easier to say something than to do it . <eou> it's not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the <unk> of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . <eou>

T-719	that's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here , i brought these especially for you , try one !

S-411	can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ? <eou> i advised customers on financial matters . after i consulted the customer , i completed a customer inquiry form and <unk> the information in our database . i then <unk> with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . the clients were then presented with a <unk> report on their financial activities that i <unk> on a quarterly basis . <eou> what is your greatest strength ? <eou> i am an excellent <unk> . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together . <eou> what is your greatest weakness ? <eou>
T-411	i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however , i began setting time - limits for myself .

S-717	i'm glad you could find time to meet with me , mr . johnson . i can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today , the ambiance here is lovely ! <eou> no problem , if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now , let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering . <eou> well , as you know , i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon-bons here in the united states . they're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . <eou> mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? belgium ? <eou>

S-1529	i hope you can give me some advice . i'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . it's such a long way from my home , but i checked and you are my nearest branch . is there anyway i can do it from home ? <eou> that's terrible . unfortunately , we don't have that many branches outside the centre of town . what i'd advise you to do is set up a direct debit service . <eou> a direct debit service ? what's that exactly ? <eou> a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . <eou> but how will you know how much i should pay ? i mean , i receive my bills , not you . <eou>
T-1529	we set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies .
